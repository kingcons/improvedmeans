Should start hacking more. Or posting about hacks? Haven't been writing anything terribly interesting lately though. Lots of config updates, work stuff, odds and ends. Little of substance. So in lieu of that, some soul nourishing poetry. Been reading more Milosz lately; Second Space, in particular. There are several really lovely pieces, here's one:<br><br><b>A Stay</b><br>My stay in that city was like a dream<br>And the dream lasted for years.<br><br>I was, in fact, not interested in anything<br>So long as I heard a voice dictating verses.<br><br>And in that way I invented a life,<br>And thus my destiny was being fulfilled.<br><br>Some people believed I was theirs,<br>So they put trust in my disguises.<br><br>I reproach myself for that,<br>For I wanted to be different,<br>Trustworthy, brave, noble-minded.<br><br>Later on I would only say: why reach so high?<br>I am and will be lame,<br>Which is no one's concern.
