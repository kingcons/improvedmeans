I had a lovely weekend. Good conversations tend to do that. I wasn't actually productive but maybe my brain was just digesting all that talk during my leisure. Also, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1">OLPC XO</a> finally arrived. I've had some fun with it though there are things to get used to. I'm trying to get it set up to work with my needs a bit better which essentially means <a href="http://www./&">getting Gambit-C and emacs-nox installed</a>. I'm also <a href="http://litenverden.org/?p=12">throwing XFCE on it</a> for a more conventional work environment. Also, I can confirm that The National's album <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_(album)">Boxer</a> was the best album of 2007 that I've heard. It's phenomenal. I'll post more on all that later.<br><br>I really feel like I should read something tasty about Ontologies and Knowledge Representations or maybe Peer Production. I don't know. I need to empty my head out. Finally, here's a tasty Neruda poem to start off the week but it's behind a cut because I don't normally post poems this long.<!--more--><br><br><em>Ode To The Atom</em><br><br>Infinitesimal<br>star,<br>you seemed<br>forever<br>buried<br>in metal, hidden,<br>your diabolic<br>fire.<br>One day<br>someone knocked<br>at your tiny<br>door:<br>it was man.<br>With one<br>explosion<br>he unchained you,<br>you saw the world,<br>you came out<br>into the daylight,<br>you traveled through<br>cities,<br>your great brilliance<br>illuminated lives,<br>you were a<br>terrible fruit<br>of electric beauty,<br>you came to<br>hasten the flames<br>of summer,<br>and then<br>wearing<br>a predator's eyeglasses,<br>armor,<br>and a checked shirt,<br>sporting sulfuric mustaches<br>and a prehensile tail,<br>came<br>the warrior<br>and seduced you:<br>sleep,<br>he told you,<br>curl up,<br>atom, you resemble<br>a Greek god,<br>a Parisian modiste<br>in springtime,<br>lie down here<br>on my fingernail,<br>climb into this little box,<br>and then<br>the warrior<br>put you in his jacket<br>as if you were nothing but<br>a North American<br>pill,<br>and he traveled through the world<br>and dropped you<br>on Hiroshima.<br><br>We awakened.<br><br>The dawn<br>had been consumed.<br>All the birds<br>burned to ashes.<br>An odor<br>of coffins,<br>gas from tombs,<br>thundered through space.<br>The shape of punishment arose,<br>hideous,<br>superhuman,<br>bloody mushroom, dome,<br>cloud of smoke,<br>sword<br>of hell.<br>Burning air rose,<br>spreading death<br>on parallel waves,<br>reaching<br>the mother sleeping<br>with her child,<br>the river fisherman<br>and the fish,<br>the bakery<br>and the bread,<br>the engineer<br>and his buildings;<br>everything<br>was acid<br>dust,<br>assassin<br>air.<br><br>The city<br>crumbled its last honeycombs<br>and fell, fell suddenly,<br>demolished,<br>rotten;<br>men<br>were instant lepers,<br>they took<br>their children's hand<br>and the little hand<br>fell off in theirs.<br>So, from your refuge<br>in the secret<br>mantle of stone<br>in which fire slept<br>they took you,<br>blinding spark,<br>raging light,<br>to destroy lives,<br>to threaten distant existences,<br>beneath the sea,<br>in the air,<br>on the sands,<br>in every twist and turn<br>of the ports,<br>to destroy<br>seeds<br>to kill cells,<br>to stunt the corolla,<br>they destined you, atom,<br>to level<br>nations,<br>to turn love into a black pustule,<br>to burn heaped-up hearts<br>and annihilate blood.<br><br>Mad spark,<br>go back<br>to your shroud,<br>bury yourself<br>in your mineral mantle,<br>be blind stone once again,<br>ignore the outlaws,<br>and collaborate<br>with life, with growing things,<br>replace motors,<br>elevate energy,<br>fertilize planets.<br>You have no secret<br>now,<br>walk<br>among men<br>without your terrible<br>mask,<br>pick up your pace<br>and pace<br>the picking of the fruit,<br>parting<br>mountains,<br>straightening rivers,<br>making fertile,<br>atom,<br>overflowing<br>cosmic<br>cup,<br>return<br>the the peace of the vine,<br>to the velocity of joy,<br>return to the province<br>of nature,<br>place yourself at our service,<br>and instead of the fatal<br>ashes<br>of your mask,<br>instead of the unleashed infernos<br>of your wrath,<br>instead of the menace<br>of your terrible light, deliver to us<br>your amazing<br>rebelliousness<br>for our grain,<br>your unchained magnetism<br>to found peace among men,<br>and then your dazzling light<br>will be happiness,<br>not hell,<br>hope of morning,<br>gift to earth.
