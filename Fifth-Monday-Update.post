This is unbelievable. Xavier Claessens is making point releases faster than my car's running out of gas. God bless him.<br>The Compcomm developers are finally <a href="http://www.ubaight.com/pipermail/compcomm/2007-June/000813.html">getting embroiled in discussion about releasing 0.1</a>. Keep an eye on that <a href="http://www.ubaight.com/pipermail/compcomm/2007-June/date.html#start">mailing list</a>. We're getting there.<br>In a rather shocking development, <a href="http://www.reactos.org/en/newsletter_25.html">Alex Ionescu has left the ReactOS project</a> after rewriting over half of the kernel and effectively serving as project lead for several years. Alex left on amicable terms and there is someone to replace him so things should move along on schedule however <a href="http://www.reactos.org/en/newsletter_26.html">the team will be skipping this month's 0.32 release to drop 0.33 on us in July</a>.<br><a href="http://symphonyos.com/cms/?p=16">SymphonyOS has finally dropped a release</a> after about  a year's silence with 2007-06. I've got to say though unless the project picks up significant momentum I feel like they should just focus on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzo_(desktop_environment)">Mezzo desktop</a> and drop the rest of the OS development.<br>This has also been <a href="http://tirdc.livejournal.com">a good week for the ATI driver based on various postings to the effective newsletter</a>, so I'm pretty pleased.<br>It's been a surprisingly large week for more general scientific developments as well:<br><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=18836">Researchers at MIT have invented the first wirelessly powered lightbulb</a>. That's right. They've unplugged us. I leave to your imagination where this goes next.<br><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=18822">Some crazy folks built a device that can simulate the effects of a hurricane</a>. I just don't know.<br><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=18832">Advances have been made in convincing stem cells to morph into various kinds of tissue</a>.<br><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=18827">A startup called LS9 is building hydrocarbon-based biofuels using synthetic biology</a>. Expect synthetic biology to play a big part in saving the planet.<br><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=18834">Candidate genes for 7 diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been found</a> thanks to a gene testing chip roughly the size of an iPod or Blackberry.<br><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=18838">Finally, a new record has been set in Quantum Cryptography by European researchers</a>. More generally this is an advance for Quantum Computing which offers numerous promises over computing as it is today. Any advance in how we handle qubits is a good advance.
