So, I've been mad about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_controversy">certain government activities</a> for years and the way the government has ignored them or brushed aside activities to end them.<br><br>We may <em>finally, <strong>really</strong> </em>have a chance to stop this now and to roll back some of the very real damage that's been done. Please, <em>everyone</em>, <a href="https://secure.eff.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=441">support the efforts</a> to <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/09/eff-supports-new-bill-repeal-telco-immunity">repeal telecom company immunity</a> and <a href="http://www.eff.org/action/rein-government-spying">reform the long unrestrained surveillance laws</a>.<br><br>I've got a phone call or two to make.<br><br>PS: Apparently, <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2009/09/29/nokia-samsung-toshiba-and-sony-align-on-mobile-high-definition/">some companies think the world needs yet another HD video connector standard</a>. My face enters my hands. That is all.<em></em>
