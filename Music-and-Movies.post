So, I'm thinking about blowing away 15,000 mp3s. What's that? Heresy you say? Why would I after having amassed such a massive music library blow most of it away? Well, somewhat predictably I just don't listen to all 17,300 some songs too often. There are about 2,500 songs that I really listen to and those have been loaded on my brand spanking new Creative Zen player. So, do I blow the rest away and free up 60 or 70 GBs of space? It seems prudent to me. We'll see. I'm not exactly running out of space but it's a consideration.<br><br>Additionally, I should probably watch a few Google videos later. They might prove interesting.
