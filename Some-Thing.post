Fireflies flicker in skies like morning dew on leaves,<br>And drift about the evening air like mist upon the breeze,<br>I don't remember time or place where I've been more at ease,<br>The world usually seems clearer the closer man is to his knees.<br>I find it hard to try to tell what path did lead me here,<br>Though always seek companion who might like to lend their ear,<br>And through dark fears in younger years persevered to present day,<br>But perhaps should have left more warnings for others along the way.<br><br>If foreign lands with beckoning sands have grounded in my mind,<br>Then perhaps discoveries lie in wait more forward than behind,<br>But putting the past aside is difficult for what might be derived<br>is a succulent fruit, of knowledge to boot, waiting to be tried.<br>Temptation though to puzzle out what meanings there may lay<br>is better left for when I rise upon an older and wiser day.<br>And until then my unseen friend I raise my glass and say,<br>Godspeed to all of us. Into the tunnel. Light the way.
