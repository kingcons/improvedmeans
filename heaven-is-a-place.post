It's been a bit of a week. I'm on vacation from work, thank goodness. I had
really run out of steam on my projects. It was difficult to focus and I was
berating myself a lot which only makes things more exhausting.

There's so much I want to work on.

I have a really, _really_ hard time making myself happy. In a lot of ways, I
think I don't know how to play by myself. You would think as an only child
that it would come naturally, but it really doesn't. I mean, I can list
things I think I'd like to do: read books, play video games, write code, etc.
I just struggle to do any of those things or feel good when I actually do
them. I think this is why the quarantine has reminded me of what summer break
felt like as a kid. There was an initial elation at this sudden freedom in
your schedule ... and then a gradual despair as nothing seems to matter
without someone to witness it.

I've been rewatching Halt and Catch Fire and very emotionally attached to it.
I think one of the reasons is that it's about these characters who obsess and
get fixated on projects but really struggle in their relationships. I feel
like I'm pretty happy with my relationships but hate myself for not moving
forward on the projects I fixate on. I identify with multiple characters on the
show and I think I struggle emotionally because they wind up alone, both
romantically and in terms of collaborators. In many ways, the show is about
failure and how the characters deal with it. And after seeing them grow as
people, work so hard, and love so fervently, it's heartbreaking to me to see
that failure.

I've been struggling with a need for external validation my whole life. I think
there are a few components to that:

1. I don't really trust my own evaluation of myself and my contributions. This
   is mirrored in HCF when Joe asks Cameron "What is it that I do?". He honestly
   can't convince himself that his contributions make people's lives better
   rather than worse.
2. Because I get very fixated on what interests me or how I think things should
   be done, I need to have a fair amount of autonomy or executive function to be
   happy and have fun. But if I'm doing anything (project or recreation) purely
   alone I lose steam and belief that it's worthwhile. The need for both
   structure and validation from collaborators while choosing not only the
   activity but also most of how it's carried out makes it really hard for me to
   find people that will come along on adventures with me.
   
Two different relationships in my life stand out as being unusually good for me
by playing to these challenges.

1. The Iron Yard was probably the happiest I've been at a job ever. I had a
   tremendous amount of freedom and responsbility in how I ran my classroom. But
   thanks to the other staff and the students, I never really felt like I was "on
   my own". I rarely got into that crazy "does it matter, is it really worth
   anything" headspace. I had external validation (mostly students),
   collaboration and friendship (staff), and autonomy in how goals were pursued.
   There was some tension because I sometimes wished I could change the broader
   educational goals or thought we weren't honest enough with our students about
   the challenges they would face, but this was dwarfed by the rest.
   
   I think this is one of the reasons teaching has often been a good job fit for
   me. Quoth the showrunners from Halt, "I think teaching is a way to spread
   your love of a thing without needing to be the victor in that particular
   arena." In a lot of ways, I struggle to to be an engineer instead of a
   teacher because I either genuinely don't think the technical problems at the
   company are interesting or because I think I need to be the victor to prove
   my worth. In teaching, the _problems_ aren't the important thing, getting
   people to connect with themselves and their curiosity is most important. Tech
   is just the setting. That feels almost perfect to me.

2. Ben Minor was my roommate both in college and after and is one of my dearest
   friends. Ben is a very easygoing guy and happy to do most whatever you want to
   do all the time. It helps that we have some overlapping interests (aside from
   code) but in 15 years of friendship, he's rarely not been open to doing whatever
   I feel interested in doing.

    I often have a hard time working on things on my own. Even if I'm legitimately
    interested in them, I struggle to make myself believe that they matter or
    generate forward motion pursuing them. I desperately want collaborators. But
    frankly, I'm pretty difficult to collaborate with because I have both pretty
    specific ideas about _what_ we should do and _how_ we should go about it. This
    makes me relate to Cameron from Halt and Catch Fire because she is genuinely
    terrible at working with others even though she would love to. She needs to be
    the special brilliant child a bit too much.

    But this also extends to how I relax and have fun. In an interview with the
    actor who plays Joe Macmillan, he said: "He wants his friends to play
    his game. I guess that's his flaw. He wants to be in the sandbox with his
    friends, but he wants his friends to be building the same sandcastle."

I don't know how to fix this, or even how to work on it really. Norma mentioned
recently that when something makes me unhappy my reaction is to stare at it
until I feel I understand or can move past it rather than to be avoidant. It
results in a lot of unhealthy feeling "stuck time" where I feel anxious and
spiral into my unhappiness. Hopefully one day I can find a little more peace,
knowing that I'm valued in the world for loving people in spite of being a
little hard to work with. I'm still a bit worried that I'm not a great software
engineer because I'm more interested in studying, learning, and sharing, than
building things. But one thing at a time.

So sure, this week I would love to:
* Work through Crafting Interpreters
* Rewrite the graphics layer in Clones
* Work through more On Lisp, SICP, CS:APP, or Algorithms
* Investigate tools for literate programming / publishing programs
* Play with org-mode
* Make a great mixtape

But I have to take care of myself first. And today, that might just mean doing
laundry, missing dad (and wishing I could listen to music with him), cuddling
the dogs, and writing. Maybe I'll spend some time in the hammock. All for now...
