Quick Monday Morning Post. So, what's been going on lately?<br>-<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070916-gtkpod-coders-crack-apples-new-ipod-checksum.html">Apple acts like tools again by being evil and using lock in on consumers</a>. This is one reason I won't buy an iPod or iPhone. I would eventually be forced to switch my Operating System. Thanks, but no. All the same, Linux developers cracked Apple's hashes inside 72 hours, making iPods on Linux workable again.<br>-<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070914-sco-files-for-chapter-11.html">SCO finally gets called out, screwed</a>. They don't own Linux, their case was thrown out, and they've filed for Chapter 11. *grin* 'Bout time. Note: Pissed shareholders. Don't lie to your shareholders.<br>-<a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~119372,00.html">AMD has released ATI video card specs and is helping develop an open source driver</a>. Makes me glad I'm an AMD/ATI guy.<br>-<a href="http://www.lshift.net/blog/2007/09/16/erlang-on-neo1973-cellphone">Erlang is running on the OpenMoko</a>. This makes me giddy for all kinds of reasons. And it's one more reason I <em>really, <strong>really</strong></em> want an <a href="http://www.openmoko.org/">OpenMoko</a>. Maybe I'll be able to get one for Xmas and replace my current phone. *crosses fingers*<br>-A "<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/09/14/system_call_sploits/page2.html">whole new class of vulnerabilities</a>" has been discovered apparently and it specifically targets multicore architectures. I'm a bit skeptical about the whole new class nonsense. Of course, it also happens to only work when shared memory is involved. Oh, hello Erlang. Don't you have shared nothing semantics? That's nice. I like those.<br><br>The to read/listen/watch list:<br><a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2455">Online Video Course on Monads</a><br><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pmarca/~3/157443648/the-three-kinds.html">The Three Kinds of Platforms on the Internet</a><br>I'm continually impressed by the guys at <a href="http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/archive/2007/09/16/361">Enfranchised Mind</a> (on Intellectual Property today).<br><a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/09/14/on_social_networks">On Social Networks</a><br><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/djg/papers/analogy_oopsla07.pdf">The Transactional Memory/Garbage Collection Analogy</a><br><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bonwick/entry/space_maps">How Space Maps work in ZFS</a><br><a href="http://fanf.livejournal.com/78346.html">Interesting thoughts on the handling on Strings in Programming Languages</a>.
