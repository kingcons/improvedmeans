Somewhere along the way, the music stopped.<br><br>It used to drift in from across the hall<br>in citrus hues and lilting arpeggios.<br>There was no exhaustion and sleep<br>was restful. We woke up, dogwood<br>blossoms falling from our lips,<br>sun streaming through the windows.<br>Sundays there was french toast<br>and the wind was always behind us.<br>Camellias and magnolias filled<br>our home and we moved about as though<br>buoyed by hummingbird wings.<br><br>But now there is no hall there.<br>So then there are no harmonies,<br>no gentle crescendos.<br>Once suffused by sweet melody,<br>we dim. Stars go out.<br>And just like that, the words all slipped<br>from my mouth to the floor.<br>I wish I had something more to tell you.<br>I don't. The music has stopped.
