I thought we all might share this.<br><br>It's titled <em>I would like to describe</em> by Zbigniew Herbert.<br><br>I would like to describe the simplest emotion<br>joy or sadness<br>but not as others do<br>reaching for shafts of rain or sun<br><br>I would like to describe a light<br>which is being born in me<br>but I know it does not resemble<br>any star<br>for it is not so bright<br>not so pure<br>and is uncertain<br><br>I would like to describe courage<br>without dragging behind me a dusty lion<br>and also anxiety<br>without shaking a glass full of water<br><br>to put it another way<br>I would give all metaphors<br>in return for one word<br>drawn out of my breast like a rib<br>for one word<br>contained within the boundaries<br>of my skin<br><br>but apparently this is not possible<br><br>and just to say - I love<br>I run around like mad<br>picking up handfuls of birds<br>and my tenderness<br>which after all is not made of water<br>asks the water for a face<br>and anger<br>different from fire<br>borrows from it<br>a loquacious tongue<br><br>so is blurred<br>so is blurred<br>in me<br>what white-haired gentlemen<br>separated once and for all<br>and said<br>this is the subject<br>and this is the object<br><br>we fall asleep<br>with one hand under our head<br>and with the other in a mound of planets<br><br>our feet abandon us<br>and taste the earth<br>with their tiny roots<br>which next morning<br>we tear out painfully.
