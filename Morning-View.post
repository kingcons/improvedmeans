Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>By dawn their will be <em>something</em> on "redlinernotes.com". I've been hacking on the server since Friday and spent a good deal of time on it so far.<br><br>It's given me it's fair share of trouble, in part because of a poorly supported network chipset and in part because of an esoteric Linux distribution. I purchased a better supported network card in the first case and have switched back to my beloved Ubuntu in the second.<br><br>At any rate, the server is on the network downstairs in it's permanent location in our basement. As soon as Ubuntu Server 6.06.1 is done installing I'll ssh into the machine and get back to it.<br><br>This has been quite a journey. Stay with me readers. The time is almost here!<br><br>Regards,<br>Editor-in-Chief<br><br>PS: Ben, are these paragraph breaks prettier?
