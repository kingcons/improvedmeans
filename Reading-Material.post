I screwed around a little this weekend trying to port some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common Lisp</a> code to <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. I hadn't messed with Haskell in months, made a bit of a fool of myself on the #haskell IRC channel and then promptly realized I'm being silly. Why? It's fun learning languages. I have half a mind to try learning some <a href="http://factorcode.org/">Factor</a> by porting the same code to it.<br><br>It's silly because I'm finally at the point where Lisp is starting to feel natural and I'm getting real work done in it. Nothing fancy or sophisticated mind you. I'm thoroughly a noob. But I'm a noob who is learning by working on bigger projects. If I give in to the "new language diversion" now, it may be fun and I may get something out of it but it's mostly writing toy programs in another language instead of continuing to work on bigger programs in a language I'm finally starting to think of as a native tongue.<br><br>So, here's some reading I hope to do in the near term:<br>I might as well get as good at SLIME as I can since it's my environment of choice. Bill Clementson has <a href="http://bc.tech.coop/blog/081209.html">a series of good articles</a>.<br>I am finally going to take some time and try to pick up web dev. I'll start at the high level and go lower as I have to. It seems like Weblocks is the most <a href="http://bitbucket.org/skypher/weblocks-stable/overview/">active</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/weblocks">awesome</a> Lisp Web Framework so I'm sure I'll be writing about that some. <a href="http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/">Hunchentoot</a> and <a href="http://weblocks.viridian-project.de/">weblocks</a> are installed on my laptop so I just need to hit <a href="http://trac.common-lisp.net/cl-weblocks/wiki/UserManual">the</a> <a href="http://viridian-project.de/~sky/user-guide.stx.html">docs</a> and get hacking.<br>If there's stuff I can't figure out how to do, between #lisp on IRC, some mailing lists and <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Common_Lisp">RosettaCode</a>, I'm sure to be in good shape.<br><br>Finally, if you're interested in lisp do as Xach said and read some of abhishek's stuff before you get started. <a href="http://abhishek.geek.nz/docs/lisp-answers/">Dispel the myths</a> and <a href="http://abhishek.geek.nz/docs/features-of-common-lisp">know about the features</a>.
