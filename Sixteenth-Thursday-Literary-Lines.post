This is the last scheduled post I'm going to write. After this, it's back to the good old days. Everything will be "Just For Fun" and I'll post what I like when I like. It's been a good experiment in generating content these past 2^4 weeks but this is the end of it. Though I do expect to have some very nerdy stuff up by Saturday. :-)<br>No promises.<br><br>That said, I'm ending with a bang. This untitled piece from <em>Unattainable Earth</em> touches on many of the frequent themes of the master poet Milosz. I hope you enjoy it:<br><br>Rustling taffetas. At sunset in a park by the Prypet River.<br>The party sets out for a walk on a path lined with flowers.<br>The fragrance of nicotianas, phlox, and resedas.<br>Great silence, the empty expanse of rising waters.<br>Meanwhile the servants bring in lamps, set the table for supper.<br>And the dining room windows lit the agaves on the lawn.<br><br>Lela, Marishka, Sophineta! Lenia, Stenia, Isia, Lilka!<br>Is it fair that I will never talk with you<br>In a language not disguised by etiquette<br>As less than language and reduced to table chatter<br>But austere and precise like a thought<br>That attempts to embrace the poor lives of beings?<br><br>I walk about. No longer human. In a hunting outfit.<br>Visiting our thick forests and the houses and manors.<br>Cold borscht is served and I am abstracted<br>With disturbing questions from the end of my century.<br>Mainly regarding the truth, where does it come from, where is it?<br>Mum, I was eating chicken with cucumber salad.<br><br>My pretty ones, abducted, beyond will and guilt.<br>My awareness harrows me as well as my silence.<br>All my life I gathered images and ideas,<br>I learned how to travel through lost territories,<br>But the moment between birth and disappearance<br>Is too much, I know, for the meager word.<br><br>Strings of wild ducks fly over the Respublica's waters.<br>Dew falls on Polish manners imported from Warsaw and Vienna.<br>I cross the river in a dugout to the village side.<br>Barking dogs greet me there and the bell of an Orthodox church.<br><br>What would I like to tell you? That I didn't get what I looked for:<br>To gather all of us naked on the earthly pastures<br>Under the endless light of suspended time<br>Without that form which confines me as it once confined you.<br><br>Seeing the future. A diviner. In a soft merciful night.<br>When pigweed grows on the paths of a cut-down garden<br>And a narrow gold chain on a white neck,<br>Together with the memory of all of you, perishes.
