I wish I had included John Mayer - New Deep and Guster - Amsterdam in the songs of summer. They'll probably be in next week's. I also am really getting back into Amon Tobin but his jazz/samba/drum'n'bass/insanity isn't really any particular season.<br><br>Lessig made a big announcement this week. I'll cover it in the monday update. He's smart and awesome.<br><br>In response to Justin last night: Linux has as many problems as you want it to. Get your hands dirty.<br><br>Speaking of, this week's linux lesson is looking like it should be fantastic. Max, get ready. Expect to learn about &lt;tab&gt; at the command prompt, more permissions, man pages, and the "|" key (that's shift backslash). It'll let you do fun things like "ls -l | wc -l" and "ps -ax | grep "yourmom"" and such.<br><br>Currently setting up subversion box and building jetty\terracotta cluster. More on that in t3h future. This week is turning out pretty nice.<br><br>Also, I was at the command prompt and ran "locate yourmom" and got nothing? So, where is she?<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>;-)
