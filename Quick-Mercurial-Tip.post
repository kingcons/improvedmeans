I hadn't actually looked into ignoring files with Mercurial until today. You can set up a file in the root of your repository called .<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/hgignore">hgignore</a> that will make your life a bit easier. Mercurial will read that file (which is a list of patterns in glob or regexp format) and will ignore any files that match those patterns when it does it's versioning work. So, want to ignore anything under the unversioned directory, mercurial configuration files and any temporary files? Here you go:<br><br><code><br>syntax: glob<br><br>unversioned/*<br>.hgrc<br>.hgignore<br>*~<br>\#*<br>*.elc<br>.DS_Store<br></code><br><br>Also, there are some great mercurial articles <a href="http://dougsland.livejournal.com/tag/hg">here</a>. I'm also playing around with <a href="http://www.xach.com/lisp/zs3/">Zach Beane's ZS3</a> library. Nice stuff. Also nice is his <a href="http://xach.livejournal.com/130040.html">Common Lisp small project guide</a>. That's damn handy. Unfortunately, all I'm using S3 for at the moment is to store <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/RedLinux-released.html">RedLinux</a> (695mb iso) and drakma <a href="http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/drakma-devel/2008-September/000732.html">currently requires loading the full file in memory</a> to upload it with PUT. I guess I'll be keeping an eye on <a href="http://www.weitz.de/">Edi Weitz</a> then. More later...
