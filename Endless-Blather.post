This post has everything.<br><br>It seems like a lot has happened in the past day or two. I'm all wrapped up preparing for a test tomorrow but there are other interesting things afoot. <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/images/teresa.jpg">Teresa</a> turned 20 today and there's going to be a party in her honor on Sunday. <a href="http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_29">Kernel 2.6.29</a> has been released, it turns out <a href="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/2009/01/18/forthcoming-p4clockmod/">cpufrequtils was never really doing anything</a> and <a href="http://www.digitalsomething.com/news/2077.html">Skate 2 finally got a patch enabling custom soundtracks</a>. EA Blackbox, even though you're two months late I'll take back some of those mean things I said. Speaking of games, someone <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps3/file/943711/56008">finally wrote a Fei Long Guide for SFIV</a>. It should hold some good lessons but I think I've got a lot of it down by this point.<br><br>I've got the webserver setup to play around with <a href="http://weblocks.viridian-project.de/documentation">weblocks</a>, <a href="http://planet.plt-scheme.org/package-source/vegashacker/leftparen.plt/4/1/planet-docs/leftparen/index.html#(part._tutorials)">leftparen</a> and <a href="http://tutorial.happstack.com/">happstack</a>. Hopefully one day I'll actually spend some time on that. It would be nice <a href="http://weblocks.viridian-project.de/installation">if weblocks was asdf-installable</a>. I don't know.  Maybe I'll just prototype GUIs in <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/3/qt.html">Chicken Scheme</a>, <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/commonqt/">Common Lisp</a> and <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt4">Python</a>. QT seems to be the cross-platform GUI toolkit of choice. It's the only one with recent bindings for all three languages.<br><br>Oh, before I forget, if you're interested in the best general write-up on SSDs I've yet seen you should <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/storage/showdoc.aspx?i=3531">read this article</a> from Anandtech. Generally I prefer the stuff at <a href="http://arstechnica.com">Arstechnica</a> but I've yet to see anyone with an article this thorough and excellent on SSDs. Well done, guys. Speaking of which, OCZ Vertex 120GB are under $400. OCZ, you've earned my faith by this one. I'll choose you guys when I have cash to blow via pricegrabber.<br><br>There are endless good recipes on the Pioneer Woman's website. I had an abundance of Chicken, I check under Entrees->Chicken and find Braised Chicken and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I've tried the <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2009/02/parmesan-crusted-chicken/">Parmesan Crusted Chicken</a> and the <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2009/03/braised-chicken/">Braised Chicken</a>. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was pretty fantastic. Braised Chicken was tasty but I didn't like it as much.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/84uqb/ask_proggit_what_is_the_best_language_to_use_for/">arguments about concurrent and parallel programming are ongoing</a>. <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/">GHC is planning a new release for Autumn</a>. I really hope the <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_Platform">Haskell Platform</a> is off the ground by then. Also, if you use Xmonad there's a good guide to Urgency Hooks <a href="http://braincrater.wordpress.com/2009/03/14/pimp-your-xmonad-4-urgency-hooks/">here</a>. Open Source development is still being thoughtfully explored. See, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/free-beer-economy">The Free as in Beer Economy</a> and <a href="http://freesouls.cc/">Freesouls</a>.<br><br>The International Lisp Conference '09 has been going on and different people have said different things about it. Andy Wingo seems to have some <a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2009/03/23/international-lisp-conference-day-one">decent</a> <a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2009/03/24/international-lisp-conference-day-two">writeups</a>. Sadly, some of the things he say make me think of what Paul Snively said in <a href="http://www.cliki.net/Paul%20Snively">his Road To Lisp survey</a> (which I realize is likely quite dated), "My own thinking is that Lisp is the cockroach of programming languages: it'll be the only one left after the apocalypse. Not bad for a dead language." Maybe in a few decades I can hope I don't suffer <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/03/echo-chamber-confidence.html">the bias of echo chambers</a>. Maybe not.<br><br>Last but not least I'll just note that I'm really enjoying Elbow tonight while doing math. Really enjoying it.<br><br><div align="center"><style type="text/css"> @import url(http://skreemr.com/styles/embed.css);</style><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><TR> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-topleft"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-topleft.gif"/></TD> <TD CLASS="sk-toprow">Elbow - Weather To Fly</TD> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-topright"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-topright.gif"/></TD></tr><TR VALIGN="MIDDLE"> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-lightleft3"/> <TD CLASS="sk-lightback3"> <embed class="SkreemRPlayer" wmode="transparent" style="height:24px;width:290px;" src="http://skreemr.com/audio/player.swf" quality="high" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="290" height="24" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" flashvars="playerID=1&bg=0xCDDFF3&leftbg=0x357DCE&lefticon=0xF2F2F2&rightbg=0xF06A51&rightbghover=0xAF2910&righticon=0xF2F2F2&righticonhover=0xFFFFFF&text=0x357DCE&slider=0x357DCE&track=0xFFFFFF&border=0xFFFFFF&loader=0xAF2910&soundFile=http://moviesofmyself.typepad.com/home/files/06_weather_to_fly.mp3"></embed> <img style="padding:0;border:0;vertical-align:bottom" src="http://skreemr.com/images/skreemr_logo_small_name_only.png"/> </td> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-lightright3"/></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="16"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-bottomleft.gif"></TD><TD CLASS="sk-bottomrow">Found at <a href="http://skreemr.com/link.jsp?id=6B524355525A66&source=embed">skreemr.com</a></TD><TD WIDTH="16"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-bottomright.gif"></TD></TR></table></div>
