I'd like to give a shout out to some people that have been loving on me. This morning that's gonna be Ember Melcher, Cathryn McCrimmon, Bria Rose, Dallas Greene, Amanda Nichols, Jason Soby, Eric Gulley, and my father (who talked to me for an hour at 2:30 am) John Glenn. I'd also like to take this opportunity to note that Marvin Gaye's What's Going On is fucking magical and can fix almost anything. That's right. I'm dancing and I'm clapping. Thank you folks. I feel like I've really made some progress. I no longer feel like there's something wrong with me or it was something I did or didn't do. Let's see if I can't maintain that.<br><br>PS: A huge thanks also goes out to Maziar Vafadari and Eric for dealing with me yesterday and also for everyone who commented on my post on Friday. It really has made a difference. Thank you.<br><br>PPS: While I'm not sure if I'm behind the new Spoon album yet (is it out for consumption or do I just have it leaked?), I'm so behind the new Maroon 5 (even though I can't really listen to it much right now), Andrew Bird (in my top 5 for this year easily), and White Stripes. I'll keep you guys posted about the new Aesop Rock, Pinback, and Radiohead as soon as I get my grimy virtual hands on them.
