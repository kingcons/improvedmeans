It's official. I'm not dead. I mean, 4 weeks without posting? I'm pretty sure that's a personal record. A variety of things have been going on, mostly positive. I spent Thanksgiving meeting the parents of my girlfriend (you know, <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/images/teresa.jpg">Teresa</a>?) in Virginia. We had volunteered to cook while we were up which went smoothly, to my relief. One thing we cooked was particularly excellent, the <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2007/06/cinammon_rolls_/">Pioneer Woman's Cinnamon Rolls</a>. They really are as good as she says. I also have finally found a <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-YGxoWg0zcrU.X3ejL9J5MPvLWyanfKuFDGBZkn_Knw--?cq=1&amp;p=4332">Fried Chicken recipe</a> that I'm happy with which is a plus as I'm hosting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock">30 Rock</a> viewing parties on Thursdays and they make a good\simple meal.<br><br>I've been wrestling with financial aid a lot lately. I'm excited about going back to school in the Spring but figuring out money always seems to be a bear. That seems to be true out of school too though. Most of the financial aid paperwork is done though, I've accepted some federal aid and I'm waiting on some private loans. Oh, the debtors joy. Also, I've got my schedule worked out and it's Tuesday-Thursday only so I'll be able to spend the rest of my time learning and hopefully pick up a part time job!

I tried that in Fall 2007. 45 minutes of battery life and temperamental wireless doesn't make for a good student laptop. I've also been working on <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=723">RedLinux</a> a bit lately and should be making a dual 686 and x86_64 release of RedLinux version 0.14 sometime next week. I'm also hoping to read some Lessig/Benkler or maybe one of the Open Sources books soon. I'd be wise to work through some of Spivak's Calculus or Head First Java before starting back at SPSU. We'll see. That's all for now.
