(In which I talk about my *feeeeeeels*)

Disclaimer: This post comes in the middle of an existential crisis.
I'm struggling a lot with programming as a career choice and feeling
disconnected from a community of excited hackers. These feelings and
opinions are my own and I think it's totally fine if you don't
subscribe to them or want to write me off as an F-ing idiot.

### Love First

A lot of the ideas in this post have been buzzing around in my head
since I saw [Jen Myers](https://twitter.com/antiheroine) deliver her
keynote at Strangeloop last year.

I've been keeping my thoughts in my head mostly because I'm already an
established programmer. A lot of the motive for the talk was to
be more welcoming to newcomers and minorities that struggled to be
included in our communities. But I think this problem affects all of
us, every last one, regardless of gender, race, or class.

The short version is that I think the tone of programming communities,
especially online ones, is horrific. It's filled with religious debate
over things *less* important than getting people excited about and
interested in computing. For me, whether it's smart people posturing
for social status or individuals genuinely trying to enlighten others
is irrelevant.

Our first reaction to any comrade, any other person passionate about
and interested in building things with computers, any human crazy and
masochistic enough to try and expand the capabilities of these absurd
machines, should be empathy and love.

This may seem ridiculous at first glance. It's harder than it sounds.

### The Same Old Arguments

You already know the religious wars I'm talking about. They're silly
little things. Are static or dynamic types better? (For some, is there
even such a thing as being dynamically typed?) Is Vim or Emacs
better? Should I learn programming with PHP or Haskell? Should my app
use JSON, XML, or a self-describing binary format? Is programming
math, art, or craft? Can code be literature?

For a host of reasons, these are questions we have a vested interest
in. And I think, more often than not, our motive is to encourage more
learning and exploration. But the conversation is almost always full
of condescension and judgment, especially if the medium for response
is limited. We simply **cannot** let supporting curiosity become
secondary to proselytizing "the right thing".

Plain and simple, turning a prompt for exploration into a right-or-wrong
religious debate is **curiosity destroying**. And that's precisely the
opposite of our intent, the opposite of what we as a community should
aspire to.

Our opinions are important, and I'm not precluding the existence of a
right answer. But someone pondering a tricky subject isn't best met by
bludgeoning them over the head with a conclusion. As long as the principal
motive of those we interact with is the fractal question "**Why?**",
we are together.

This connects to a lot of things. It connects to people wondering if
they're good at programming, or how to know such a thing. It
contributes to impostor syndrome. I've struggled to hack on hobby code
for fun because I don't feel like I can be proud of it. Not smart
enough, not groundbreaking enough, not important enough.

So the more we can get away from emphasizing that the most important
thing in programming is **being right**, the better that will be for
newcomers, for hobbyists, and I believe, for all of us.

### Epilogue

I'm reminded of an Alan Perlis quote in SICP:

> "I think that it's extraordinarily important that we keep the fun in computing.
> ... We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the
> successful, error-free, perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are.

> I think we're responsible for stretching them,
> setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house."

I'm not perfect at this either. It is difficult to never be dismissive,
let alone to always be gentle. But sometimes people are just trying to
make it through the day. Not use the best tool, not come up with a
groundbreaking solution, not fix the world. We need to try to meet
other programmers where *they* are. Not move them to our habitat
before empathizing, before loving.


Ironically, I know this has been a bit of a high-horse diatribe.
At least let me give you a gift for coming so far and listening to me
ramble so much. Here, have something I love:
