In the last 3 weeks, Paktahn 0.9.2 and 0.9.3 have been released. Go <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=30242">install or upgrade</a> it, quick! Leslie Polzer has passed on the role of Maintainer to me and I was privileged to accept it. Paktahn had been pretty quiet from May-Aug 2010 and was practically silent Aug-Dec 2010. As a consequence, a big part of my focus right now is revitalizing the project, making it clear we're still working on it and making it easy for new contributors to join in.<br><br>The biggest focus of the last two releases have been bugfixes, unifying the code style and reorganizing the project some. For example, my old gitorious repo has been taken down, all the TODO items are now in one place, etc. That doesn't mean there are no new features though. Among other things you can now finally upgrade all packages by running "pak -Syu --aur", pak -Ss which behaves like pacman -Ss extended to support AUR and various UI improvements. The rest is visible in the <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/paktahn/blob/master/NEWS">NEWS</a> as always.<br><br>My plans for the next two releases can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/paktahn/blob/c98f2c3bfbf27796eca92dac128ea6e43de67ab9/TODO">TODO</a>. The short version is that I'm going to improve our option handling so pak can be used for as many pacman tasks as possible (i.e. -Q*, etc) and clean up the code for the next release. There should also be some small UI improvements. After that, I'm going to get a solid test suite in place. My github repo is the <a href="http://github.com/redline6561/paktahn">canonical source location</a> at this point but Leslie's Issues page is the <a href="http://github.com/skypher/paktahn/issues">canonical bugtracker</a>. As always, please file any bug reports or feature requests you have there. If there's any other feedback you have about the project you're welcome to post it on <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=77674&amp;p=6">our forum thread</a>.<br><br>I'm going to try to run a tighter release cycle for a little bit. There have already been two releases in January. I guarantee that there will be another point release so 0.9.4 is out by the end of February, I can't guarantee any more than that at this time though. That's all for now. I've got to get to sleep for an early class.
