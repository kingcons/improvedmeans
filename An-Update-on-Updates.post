Dear Friends,<br><br>I appear to have entered into a coma. I'm not depressed, sad or grieving but I am a victim of constant exhaustion and perpetually low energy. I expected to only need rest the two weeks after classes wrapped up and then be able to spend 3-4 weeks "playing". Playing meaning working on things that I like, Lisp, Haskell, reading CS books, weekly blogging and the like.<br><br>This has not come to pass. Instead, I'm on vacation and very blob-like. Some of this has to do with my father's passing. What I'm sure of is that I need this time and that growing as a person, learning more about code and so on, will disappointingly have to wait.<br><br>A lot has been happening (nerd news-wise) and the tabs in my browser have filled back up. It's not up to the record number of spring semester (200+?!?) but I hope to dump out a few linkposts and clean out the cruft over the next week or so. Before classes start back up. Oy vey.<br><br>In the meantime, I'm missing you folks.<br><br>PS: My <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=1011">berrics bracket</a> is <a href="http://www.theberrics.com/dailyopspost.php?postid=1239">totally f-ed</a>. Thanks a lot, Chris Haslam! ;)
