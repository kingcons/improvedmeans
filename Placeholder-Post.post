So another week has passed and apparently it's time for me to write another blog post. I have some interesting things I've been wanting to talk about but unfortunately I don't have the time to post right now. I may later on this week, say Friday, but finals and schoolwork is taking precedent for the time being.<br><br>I'll still say a few brief things here just so you know what's coming.<br><ul><br>	<li> Dad has had some recent complications and we're still waiting for word from the doctors as to what can be done about them. More forthcoming.</li><br>	<li> I happened to remember and watch Fist of Legend over the weekend which got me thinking about Cross Training and reading modern martial arts history on Wikipedia.</li><br>	<li>I've been recognizing some things about why I like Smash Bros so much and why Street Fighter IV has been trying for me even though I find much to commend it.</li><br>	<li>Teresa and I are all set to move in to the Aventine at Ashford May 8th. There will be a goodbye Windsor house party/video game tourney/thing before then.</li><br></ul>
