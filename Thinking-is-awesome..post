So excited right now. So many awesome things happening. I can hardly wait to write the news on the next monday update. Hell with it, I'll post some things I've looked at read or thought about in the last 48 hours.<br>A couple of things.<br><a href="http://hoegsberg.blogspot.com/">Kristian Hoegsberg is amazing</a>.<br>I'm starting to think that <a href="http://macslow.thepimp.net/?p=139">given time</a> Ubuntu/Linux can <a href="http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/">out</a>-<a href="http://www.launchpad.net/awn">Mac</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/">Mac</a>. More explanation necessary. I'll get to you.

Maybe more so than anybody else. And yet they still act funky with Java. <a href="http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9757417-16.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=TheOpenRoad">I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about this</a>.<br><a href="http://rescubuntu.info/node/1">This looks really useful</a> for next time I encounter data loss.

It's not just wikipedia tough. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/google_uses_cro.html">Everyone is getting in on the peer production action</a>. Peer production will only become more visible.<br>There <em>are</em> lots of books that should be written about software. <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/notontheshelves.html">These are some</a>. This is interesting as a look at where things are\might be headed.<br>I continue to be torn up about the language wars. Are they in some ways just plain silly? <a href="http://www./&">Yes</a>. All the same, furthering our tools matters. A lot.

Or at least I did until this summer. Of course, I basically just heard about Apache and IIS until this summer. I'd never actually run/setup/worked with web servers until this summer. I kind of feel like that market is in the <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">midst</a>/<a href="http://www.cherokee-project.com/">outset</a> of a <a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/Nginx">shake</a> <a href="http://www.mortbay.org/">up</a> though. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JamesGovernorsMonkchips/~3/142380249/">Observe</a>.<br><a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2007/08/03/amazon_fps/">Amazon's hardware as a service stuff</a> just gets more and more interesting as the days go by.

There are <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/04/19/busyness-vs-burst-why-corporate-web-workers-look-unproductive/">different work styles</a> emerging. We'll see what comes of it.<br>I'm really excited that <a href="http://blip.tv/file/319044/">there is video of Steve Yegge talking online</a>. I can't believe I haven't looked for some before. He's so damn smart I'll listen to anything he says. It links to all the other OSCON 2007 content too which is great because I've been wondering why GUADEC, OSCON, and Ubuntu Live content is all over t3h int4rwebz. Conferences are good because of mindshare but please share your geniuses keynotes with me. Imitate TED.<br><a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2007/08/02/online_desktop/">Keep working at those Online Desktop chestnuts</a>. Even if it doesn't turn out to be the right problem, it sure will help our platform stand out.<br><a href="http://www.linux-ha.org/ClusterIP">I'm really glad this exists</a>.

Between this and some 3D printing reports from Siggraph 2007 I have high hopes for what will be possible by 2020.<br>Lessig is awesome. So is <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/code_looks_like.html">proof of how awesome he is</a>.<br>If you think the web isn't almost an OS layer itself, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/your_web_browse.html">you're wrong</a>.

Whether it's the web(Online Desktop), mobile (iPhone, OpenMoko), other embedded or home theater, or some strange new device (OLPC XO, <a href="http://times.usefulinc.com/2007/08/04-zonbu">Zonbu</a>, zareason, minis and micro-atx, etc) there are strong currents in this sea.<br><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/desrt/2007/08/07/im-excited-about-the-future-of-gnome/">Gnome and Linux really are doing good things</a>.

What distinction?<br><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/payscale_where.html">Knowing job projections is useful</a>.<br><br>Kernels are interesting, you've got Linux, BSDs, Solaris, Darwin\XNU, whatever powers XP and Vista. But they're really just parts of the stack. All the same, they're really important parts of the stack. Infrastructure will always matter. It's just not the focus now. What we're building with it is the focus. The OS is irrelevant in so much as it's just an enabler. This sounds obvious and stupid. I need to think more on what I'm trying to say.<br><br>Maybe the processor industry going massively multicore is the only way to force software developers to take advantage of the power that's already there. By forcing them to adopt new programming conventions they force out 30 years of cruft code and development methodology that is bug-prone. Goodbye imperative, hello functional.<br><br>Okay, that's it for now. Sorry for the linkflood\social braindump.
