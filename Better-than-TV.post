Here are a few video lectures I've enjoyed that simply never could have made it to Television. Too much of a niche audience I suppose. They'll go from most comprehensible to non-nerds/programmers to incomprehensible to non-nerds/programmers. Soon I'll post up something actually productive or cool. For now, it's all school.<br><br>I still really like <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/archaeopteryx-bowkett">Giles Bowkett's RubyFringe presentation</a> from last year. It really starts in after the musical presentation of the first seven minutes. It's good fun even if you don't program and you can see a glimmer of why programmer's would be interested in what it is they do.<br><br>I also fervently love "The Graphing Calculator Story" which I read in text somewhere before stumbling across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl643JFJWig">this video</a>.<br><br>Finally, I watched <a href="http://blog.cusec.net/2009/01/05/zed-shaw-the-acl-is-dead-cusec-2008/">Zed Shaw's CUSEC talk</a> last night and was forced to conclude that I both like Zed Shaw and very much like his talk.<br><br>Now, when you need a break, watch something.
