I didn't even realize I hadn't posted in over a week. I just got through the first big "crunch period" in school and did pretty well. This weekend will be relaxation and unwinding to a pretty large extent. So what's happened besides the school stuff?<br><br>I got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_IV">Street Fighter IV</a>. I am planning on throwing a tournament...details forthcoming. I already think I prefer my Smash Bros tournaments.<br>I'm enjoying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Foxes">Fleet Foxes</a> and also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stills">The Stills</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Weekend">Vampire Weekend</a> at moment. Mmm, mmm, music.<br><a href="http://archlinux.org">ArchLinux</a> finally put out a new release for the first time in a while. They're also going to try to drop releases with each Kernel release from now on which would be pretty damn cool. A distro that releases 4 times a year? Watch out. Not that most of us Archers don't just install and roll along...<br><a href="http://freeshells.ch/~revence/par.txt">This is my jam</a> and beautifully and entertainingly explains what I'm trying to say about parallel programming and the future. It also advocates haskell a bit which is nice.<br><a href="http://notes-on-haskell.blogspot.com/2007/02/whats-wrong-with-for-loop.html">This just generally talks smack about for loops</a> which is not a bad thing. I'm so sick of for loops. I'm not going to get into my snobbery right here. Just know that the fact that I ought to learn C for the future so I can deal with the past is a little frustrating at times.<br>Finally, I'm 3 for 3 on my <a href="http://theberrics.com/">berrics</a> predictions and with any luck I'll be 4 for 4 this weekend when Marc Johnson <strong><em>finally</em></strong> fights Steve Berra.
