Well, it seems a lot has happened since last time. An additional lisp library for concurrency called <a href="http://www.cliki.net/Calispel">Calispel</a> has been released and is up on Cliki. Unfortunately, it depends on cl-jpl-utils which in turn depends on cl-rsm-queue, neither of which are on Cliki. Such is life. There are good things though, a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.openmcl.devel/4770">release candidate for CCL 1.4</a> has been put out. I've also started a branch porting Paktahn to Embedded Common Lisp. It didn't wind up being as tricky as I thought. Hopefully, I'll have something I can merge to master in a week or two. Of course, I wouldn't have gotten anywhere without <a href="http://blog.viridian-project.de/about/">Leslie</a>. Geez, that guy is patient. Anyway, what about non-lisp news? The ACM Reflections conference is over and hopefully <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/videos.html">videos will be posted</a> soon. Additionally, there's been <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.factor.general/3454">some</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9ukis/improved_write_barriers_in_factors_garbage/">discussion</a> about whether or not it's time for Factor 1.0. There's still really great work being done on the language implementation. I would like a proper book for it and binaries to be available in my linux distro but I can wait.<br><br>There's also been a good discussion on what math programmers need to know on reddit recently. The outstanding comments (IMO) are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9uo0z/programmers_should_know_math_just_not_all_of_it/c0ej8az">here</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9uo0z/programmers_should_know_math_just_not_all_of_it/c0eiqo4">here</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9uo0z/programmers_should_know_math_just_not_all_of_it/c0eisdp">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9uo0z/programmers_should_know_math_just_not_all_of_it/c0eiv0w">here</a>. Similarly, there was a good thread a few weeks back titled "What do you wish you knew when you started programming?".Â  A few of my favorite comments are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9pc69/what_are_some_things_you_wish_you_knew_when_you/c0dtcgb">here</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9pc69/what_are_some_things_you_wish_you_knew_when_you/c0dtllp">here</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9pc69/what_are_some_things_you_wish_you_knew_when_you/c0dt23h">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9pc69/what_are_some_things_you_wish_you_knew_when_you/c0dte34">here</a>. More importantly, there was a <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/">very enjoyable article</a> and <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/14/hello-to-slashdotters-gervais-principle-follow-ups/">followup</a> about Office Politics as interpreted by Hugh MacLeod and The Office. As some folks in the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=881296">hackernews thread</a> mention, the model isn't universally applicable. Yep, that's right. It's a model. Go figure.<br><br>Well, it's been a very hard week. Mostly because I just hate my Algorithms class. I don't hate algortihms just the way it's being presented and taught. I'm pretty sure I can overcome the obstacles involved, I'm just much less motivated to do so than I would like. The last two semesters I really had a fire under my butt about school for some reason. Maybe not but when I had to rise to the challenge, it was relatively easy to do so and I was kind of proud of that since it was a divergence from my past. This semester the fight just isn't in me and I have next to no pride in what I'm doing in school. I'm sort of coasting and I'm finding it hard to break out of that. Of course, I'm learning the material and I'm doing extracurricular things to improve my knowledge, joy and understanding because <em><strong>I care about programming</strong></em>. Whether that's stupid or not is another question but also kind of irrelevant, I didn't choose to be fascinated by this stuff. I just can't help it. So I'm not doing what I love, I'm doing what I can't help but do. It's gonna be a long road.<br><br>I've still been getting a few things done. I've written a few quick hackish, sbcl-dependent scripts. Maybe I'll post some of the code for them soon. I started working on Redlinux again. The last release I made was <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/RedLinux-Revamped.html">back in May</a> and a lot has changed since then, more about my approach than about Redlinux. I'm hoping to make a new release by the end of November. So far the big change is my build process. As in, now there actually is one. It should be <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/docs/redlinux/fresh_redlinux.txt">trivial</a> to rebuild from scratch in the future. See what a non-distribution it is? The upcoming release should have a nice proper script for creating a new user and doing a little initial setup. Above and beyond that, I'm hoping to work on the documentation some. If anything, the real problem is it may not fit on a single CD with all the programming software I've bundled in.<br><br>A while back I wrote a post on getting an undergraduate CS education for under $1,000. It was mostly focused on which books and resources were ideal for self-study. I reworked said list and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/RTK97991HYF8T/ref=cm_lm_pthnk_view?ie=UTF8&amp;lm_bb=">posted it on Amazon</a> over the weekend. A lot of my decisions about what's worthwhile for self-study has changed (since I've actually read more). My motivation stems largely from the fact that I prefer self-study to school. Finally, there are two slightly <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Bursting-Browsers.html">older</a> <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Its-True.html">articles</a> of mine that linked to a bunch of really interesting articles that are still among my favorite blog posts I've stumbled upon since trolling the internet for programming stuff. I'm hoping to do a real writeup on a number of these articles and add in a few of my own ideas in the near future. And since I'm calling it "the near future" you know advance I'll never get around to it. Well, hopefully not. :)<br><br>That's all for now. Back to homework guys.
