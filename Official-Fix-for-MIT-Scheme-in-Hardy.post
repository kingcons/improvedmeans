Bug reports work! Finlay McWalter commented on the bug report saying that the package maintainer, Chris Hanson, found a fix for the issue. <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4868292">His fix</a> is far better than <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=897">my workaround</a>. Apparently, AppArmor is preventing applications (such as MIT-Scheme) from accessing lower memory. The fix is to edit /etc/sysctl.conf and change the vm.mmap_min_addr value from 65536 to 0. Afterwards, MIT-Scheme works just fine.<br><br>In other news, this has been a really disastrous Monday.
