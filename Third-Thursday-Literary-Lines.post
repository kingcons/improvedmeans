Livejournal hasn't let me post from my computer since late yesterday so I had to log on to a friend's computer to make a post to fix the problem. Today I'd like to share the third of (what are probably) my three favorite Milosz poems.<br><br>Winter<br><br>The pungent smells of a California winter,<br>Grayness and rosiness, an almost transparent full moon.<br>I add logs to the fire, I drink and I ponder.<br><br>"In Ilawa," the news item said, "at age 70<br>Died Aleksander Rymkiewicz, poet."<br><br>He was the youngest in our group. I patronized him slightly,<br>Just as I patronized others for their inferior minds<br>Though they had many virtues I couldn't touch.<br><br>And so I am here, approaching the end<br>Of the century and of my life. Proud of my strength<br>Yet embarrassed by the clearness of the view.<br><br>Avant-gardes mixed with blood.<br>The ashes of inconceivable arts.<br>An omnium-gatherum of chaos.<br><br>I passed judgment on that. Though marked myself.<br>This hasn't been the age for the righteous and the decent.<br>I know what it means to beget monsters<br>And to recognize in them myself.<br><br>You, moon, You, Aleksander, fire of cedar logs.<br>Waters close over us, a name lasts but an instant.<br>Not important whether the generations hold us in memory.<br>Great was that chase with the hounds for the unattainable meaning of<br>the world.<br><br>And now I am ready to keep running<br>When the sun rises beyond the borderlands of death.<br><br>I already see mountain ridges in the heavenly forest<br>Where, beyond every essence, a new essence waits.<br><br>You, music of my late years, I am called<br>By a sound and a color which are more and more perfect.<br><br>Do not die out, fire. Enter my dreams, love.<br>Be young forever, seasons of the earth.
