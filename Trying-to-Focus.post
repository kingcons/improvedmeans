I've put myself in a rough position over the past few days. I should've been getting more math done but that's the past. I'm having a fair amount of trouble with inductive proofs but not because induction is tricky. Induction makes sense. Remembering how to transform equations with algebra is tricky and I'm quite rusty which makes it mostly frustrating and/or embarassing.<br><br>Anyway, there's a test on Thursday and I've got 5 sections of Homework problems to get through by then. Hopefully, if I can pull that off I won't do too poorly. I got an 89 or some such on the last test. I had some extra credit that bumped it up to an A.<br><br>I've been worried about <em>my</em> future a lot lately. I know that to some degree I went back to school just to know I'd be able to make money when I got out. In some ways, it was a move of desperation. In others, I thought it made sense to wrap up. Trying to teach yourself to code and working full time in IT wound up being a bit conflicting for me.<br><br>The important thing is I don't just want to make it. I don't want to just get out of school and be employable but I'm not learning enough or coding enough on my own to be more than that. So I'm looking at how to impose more structure and have more discipline to get more real coding done because <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/code">this shortlog</a> is just ridiculous, even though I did write <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/code/rev/5b8bc8cbfa98">a decent amount of Haskell</a> over the break.<br><br>I want to see commitment and I want to see commits. I want to turn this guilt into motivation and that motivation into code. I can't say I love programming yet, I'm just fascinated by it...but I think if I keep at it one day I might get there.<br><br>PS: Listening to Gorillaz, their debut album. Definitely quality. Listening to Tim Hecker's new stuff. It's nice, particularly "Borderlands". A bit of Jaydiohead. It's nice. And Panda Bear...it's weirdly pleasant, particularly "<a href="http://skreemr.com/link.jsp?id=605D4A5D505C&amp;artist=Panda%20Bear&amp;title=Comfy%20In%20Nautica">Comfy in Nautica</a>" and "<a href="http://skreemr.com/link.jsp?id=675946575C5F6B&amp;artist=Panda%20Bear&amp;title=Bros">Bros</a>".
