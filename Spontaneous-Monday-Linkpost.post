<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/runa-sankarshan/2301461767/sizes/o/">Bookshelf Jealousy</a><br><br>I need to <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/2299108310_25fe307f58_d.jpg">try</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ogmaciel/2255962057/">OpenBox</a> and build a trim install from the ground up <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=283">again</a>. Maybe with Gentoo this time? Or should I stick to Arch of Foresight?<br><br>I continue to hear <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pmarca/~3/244777356/an-hour-and-a-h.html">good things about Barack Obama</a>. Staggering amounts of good things. It's not that Marc Andreesen is saying this. It's that everyone who's had contact with the guy is saying this. Also, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/opinion/01rosen.html?_r=1&ex=1362200400&en=d3c8a88b587068f5&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin">he's big on civil liberties</a>. Maybe from lecturing on Constitutional Law at University of Chicago. Hopefully that means he'll handle <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/02/anonymous-gop-operatives-surprised-fearmongering-isnt-working">these fiascos</a> a little better than the current administration. It wouldn't be too hard.<br><br>I really want to hear a good comparison of <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bzr</a> and <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> and I'm <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/62z0v/comments/">not convinced I've heard one yet</a>. It seems to be very "<a href="http://www.ivy.fr/blog/index.php/2008/02/25/82-git-linus-is-a-designer">Linus made Git!</a>" vs "<a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/newren/2008/03/01/happenings-in-the-vcs-world/">Yeah but mere mortals can use Bzr!</a>". Please guys can we elevate the sophistication in this debate?<br><br>Luis Villa comes up with some great ideas and <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2008/02/25/gnome-background-questions/">this is one of them</a>. Also, I may finally have to try greasemonkey because <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2008/02/28/reason-for-more-flickr-pictures/">adding pictures to my posts</a> continually sounds like a better and better idea. Well, at least some of my posts. While we're on Luis though, I take RSS feed reading seriously but I don't get <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2008/02/09/in-market-for-new-feed-reader/">near 800 feeds a day</a>. I'd be interested in hearing what he settles on.<br><br>I'm wondering if I should start <a href="http://johnc4510.wordpress.com/?p=33">contributing to Ubuntu's Weekly Newsletter</a>. It'd be a chance to do some volunteer work for a community I do care about and I have been thinking that down the road I might like to do some freelance writing so it wouldn't be a bad way to get a feel. What can I say? <a href="http://bushidobrown.livejournal.com/193189.html">Ben</a> <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=257#comments">inspired me</a>.<br><br>I'm glad people are thinking about the future. This <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/worldchanging_fulltext/~3/234559180/007838.html">article from worldchanging</a> appears particularly promising. Anyone have any formal responses to this? I'm going to work on mine along with an update of the Secondhand Standards essay.<br><br>Also, I'm not personally a Nine Inch Nails fan but it is pretty cool that they've <a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/03/nin_goes_cc.html">released their latest album as CC'd work</a> and I kind of hope Radiohead does that with their next album...<br><br>Personally, I share <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/">sogrady's</a> <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2008/02/25/have-i-finally-found-what-im-looking-for/">taste in laptops</a> and while I'm not in the market right now I am wildly optimistic about <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Lenovo_X300">grabbing one of these</a> in a year or so off craigslist or something.<br><br>I'm trying to really get into <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Emacs">emacs</a>. I want to settle on an editor and really learn it. Since I'm learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> for the next year or so Emacs seems like an insanely reasonable place to start. Making it <a href="http://peadrop.com/blog/2007/09/17/pretty-emacs-reloaded/">pretty seems like a good idea</a> though.<br><br>Finally, this guy is totally awesome and I hope I can come up with <a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2008/02/29/im-telling-you">a project as cool as this</a> after my self-education.
