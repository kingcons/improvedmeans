Two random quotes this morning from two random sources, Andy Wingo (programmer living in spain and working three days a week. Oh, the jealousy!!!) and Paul Kedrosky (VC\Finance Guy).<br><blockquote>"Perhaps I am more than usually jealous of my freedom. I feel that my connections with and obligations to society are at present very slight and transient. Those slight labors which afford me a livelihood, and by which I am serviceable to my contemporaries, are as yet a pleasure to me, and I am not often reminded that they are a necessity. So far I am successful, and only he is successful in his business who makes that pursuit which affords him the highest pleasure sustain him. But I foresee that if my wants should be much increased the labor required to supply them would become a drudgery. If I should sell both my forenoons and afternoons to society, neglecting my peculiar calling, there would be nothing left worth living for. I trust that I shall never thus sell my birthright for a mess of pottage.<br><br>H. Thoreau<br>10 January, 1851"</blockquote><br><a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2007/12/18/in-which-our-protagonist-changes-jobs">Sourced from Andy Wingo</a><br><br>Quote deux...<br><blockquote>"To be truly challenging, a voyage, like a life, must rest on a firm foundation of financial unrest. Otherwise you are doomed to a routine traverse, the kind known to yachtsmen, who play with their boats at sea--"cruising", it is called. Voyaging belongs to seamen, and to the wanderers of the world who cannot, or will not, fit in. If you are contemplating a voyage and you have the means, abandon the venture until your fortunes change. Only then will you know what the sea is all about.</blockquote><br><blockquote>Little has been said or written about the ways a man may blast himself free. Why? I don't know, unless the answer lies in our diseased values. A man seldom hesitates to describe his work; he gladly divulges the privacies of alleged sexual conquests. But ask him how much he has in the bank and he recoils into a shocked and stubborn silence.</blockquote><br><blockquote>"I've always wanted to sail to the South Seas, but I can't afford it." What these men can't afford is <em>not</em> to go. They are enmeshed in the cancerous discipline of "security". And in the worship of security we fling our lives beneath the wheels of routine---and before we know it our lives are gone.</blockquote><br><blockquote>What does a man need---really need? A few pounds of food each day, heat and shelter, six feet to lie down in---and some form of working activity that will yield a sense of accomplishment. That's all---in the material sense. And we know it. But we are brainwashed by our economic system until we end up beneath a pyramid of time payments, mortgages, preposterous gadgetry, playthings that divert our attention from the sheer idiocy of the charade.</blockquote><br><blockquote>The years thunder by. The dreams of youth grow dim where they lie caked in dust on the shelves of patience. Before we know it, the tomb is sealed.</blockquote><br><blockquote>Where, then, lies the answer? In choice. Which shall it be: bankruptcy of purse or bankruptcy of life?"</blockquote><br>From Sterling Hayden's Wanderer <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2008/07/16/words_to_live_b.html">via Paul Kedrosky</a>
