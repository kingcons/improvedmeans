Things have been fairly ridiculous for the last 10 days. I won't go into details because they concern some other people that might not want them discussed. That said, things have been fairly ridiculous and I've had a hard time focusing on doing schoolwork or anything else. I'm trying not to get overwhelmed by everything. I feel like I can't keep up with school and personal pursuits but that's far from the truth and I'm slowly trying to get my head together. That means it's time for something uplifting though and I've haven't posted any Milosz in a while so here we go.<br><br>Earth Again by Czeslaw Milosz, excerpted from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unattainable-Earth-Czeslaw-Milosz/dp/0880011025">Unattainable Earth</a> pg. 8<br>They are incomprehensible, the things of this earth.<br>The lure of waters. The lure of fruits.<br>Lure of the two breasts and long hair of a maiden.<br>In rouge, in vermillion, in that color of ponds<br>Found only in the Green Lakes near Wilno.<br>And ungraspable multitudes swarm, come together<br>In the crinkles of tree bark, in the telescope's eye,<br>For an endless wedding,<br>For the kindling of the eyes, for a sweet dance<br>In the elements of the air, sea, earth and subterranean caves,<br>So that for a short moment there is no death<br>And time does not unreel like a skein of yarn<br>Thrown into an abyss.<br><br>PS: My bracket predictions have been correct for <a href="http://www.theberrics.com/dailyops.php">the berrics</a> two out of two times thus far. Post some <a href="http://www.theberrics.com/batb.php">brackets</a> people!
