You may have noticed that I didn't make a Third Thursday Literary Lines post yesterday. That's because I broke Livejournal. I wrote a post, hit the post button and then went to change the status of the post from private to public as it was posting. The post didn't go through successfully and I haven't been able to post any number of things to my livejournal from my computer since. I am posting this from a friend's computer and suspect it will go through after which blogging will resume as normal with the (belated) Third Thursday post and today's Third Friday post.<br><br>Don't ask me how I knew this would fix it.<br><br>Stupid Web apps.
