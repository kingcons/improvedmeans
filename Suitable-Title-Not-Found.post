My father, John M Glenn Jr passed away (very peacefully I'm told) at 10:15am.<br>I had just gotten on a train to Arts Center to get on a bus to school.<br>I know I'll have more to say about him later, I'm not sure I'll find much to say about his passing. It's pretty hard to analyze or make sense of. There are really only two places to approach it from, an objective and detached place that can't signify the importance of the event as it's just the course of life or an emotional, irrational place which can't grant it importance enough.
