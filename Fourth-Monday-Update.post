Talk about release early, release often. These guys are on fire.<br><a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora 7 was also released to the world</a>. While this release isn't particularly noteworthy for it's technical achievements it is noteworthy for it's infrastructural or community achievements which may facilitate greater innovation and work in the future. Here's looking forward to F8.<br>The team over at <a href="http://www.pcsx2.net">PCSX2 released a progress update</a>.

Interesting.<br>Microsoft talks about <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4217348.html">surface computing</a> but I'm more interested in <a href="http://www.perceptivepixel.com/">Perceptive Pixel</a> with Jeff Han.

Damn.
