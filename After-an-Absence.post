Oh, hello. You're the only one reading today aren't you? You are. Welcome.<br><br>10 days? 10 DAYS? Where have I been? Busy I suppose. And in case you noticed the server being down, it turns out the router it sits behind decided to go crazy...which is almost comforting. /*This entry dedicated to <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/10/until-you-understand-how-forth-is.html">Raganwald</a>, <a href="http://xkcd.com/329/">XKCD</a>, Radiohead, and Amazon.com for keeping me occupied and away from you guys for so long.*/ So, what's been going on?<br><br>First, I actually wrote something today. It's been a while since that happened and it felt good. It's not fantastic but it's a start and maybe I'll be able to polish it up some in the future. I don't know that it was inspired by the following Milosz quote, but the quote resounds particularly with me today so I'm shoving it in your face anyway.<br>"There must be a middle place between abstraction and childishness where one can speak seriously about serious things." - Czeslaw Milosz, Second Space, 4. I Apologize (pg. 49)<br><br>And here's the as yet untitled poem, please file naming suggestions below:<br>How surprised was I to learn that the dichotomy was not that of good and evil, as expected.<br>Rather, torn between shame and the frivolity of a bottomless awe.<br>Bound mesmerized to the spectacle of the world and all the marvelous constructions within it.<br>I found myself vertiginous, perhaps self-aware, but certainly unsure how to contribute to so great a vista.<br>As though asked to add new colors to the horizon, or change the sound of the ocean on a starry night.<br>That task is too monumental for me, I said. But awe is not enough, my immense wonder is insufficient.<br>Still, it is better to make public a frivolous and joyous etonnement than to admit<br>to the truth: That every man is a thunderclap receding into the distance, and silence.<br><br>Second, on Friday we had the best video game tournament in probably 10 months or so, IMHO. I actually did well in Melee with Zelda/Sheik. Semifinals well. The small atmosphere and various special appearances made the evening though. Derin and Pete were both able to come and I had lost touch with Derin so that was particularly awesome.<br><br>Third, the new Radiohead album is out and it's outstanding. What's more outstanding is that Radiohead are releasing and self-distributing the album as a download via their website and you decide what to pay them for it. That actually might not be more outstanding than the album itself which could be the best thing since OK Computer. More to come but I really like it and the early favorites are Reckoner and Jigsaw Falling Into Place followed by Nude and All I Need. I'm still pretty skeptical about the last track, Videotape. There's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0MI3gtaqfY">live acoustic version on Youtube</a> that just sounds better to my ears.<br><br>Fourth, I figured if I'm really going to take a year off to self-study and see if learn more/better/faster/stronger/etc that I'd better come up with a sort of reading list. Thank goodness for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/32H7I8DJX2WWE/">Amazon.com wishlists</a>. I figured I might as well include a bunch of the stuff from my earlier book lists as well. The Computer Science stuff is thither.<br><br>That's all for now. More later.
