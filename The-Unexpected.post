This poem was unexpected but I blame it's inspiration on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop">Hofstadter</a>, <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/Feyerabend/Feyerabend.html">The Feyerabend Project</a> (particularly the Sussman quote at the end, NO ONE pays enough attention to the Sussman quote at the end), and <a href="http://www.alphamagazine.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=1897101">the quants</a>.<br><br>There is a dim luminescence<br>on the edge of the world<br>drawing close. I hardly<br>see it's call but hear my<br>heart rise on approach.<br><br>The things unnamed we<br>can't contain, powerless<br>we act in vain. The systems<br>built stay brittle, break<br>when under stress they<br>cannot take. The deeper<br>message anathema to our<br>craven fantasies.<br><br>It may come for ill or gain<br>and is not my place to complain,<br>I know not what instruction awaits<br>so idly move at pleasant gait.<br>I hope the best for all of us,<br>for meritocracies in which to trust,<br>but utopia has no need of randomness<br>with which the universe is enamored.<br><br>The glamor and gore of that<br>midnight show I will not see<br>and will not know. I'll laugh<br>a good deal as I go but it<br>speeds like a star's falling.<br>If we find whatever defines<br>the space where interaction<br>takes it's place and emerging<br>from names is a trace<br>of self I shan't be surprised.<br><br>PS: I discovered that the Sussman quote at The Feyerabend Project was sourced from <a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:qhMMWmbNuEAJ:swiss.csail.mit.edu/projects/amorphous/workshop-sept-99/robust-diversity.pdf+robust+diversity&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a">this paper</a>. It may give some insight into all this.
