<p>Today was not the easiest day. It wasn't terrible either. The news was decidedly mixed. And it's not about Dad though if you're wondering he's doing well. He's undergone chemo and lost most of his hair but he's generally upbeat and energetic.</p><br><p>Two things have been wearing on me today and the first is work-related. Since January 11th I've been working full time at TVS. The news was that I finally got the paperwork for my benefits package today. It's nice having benefits. Benefits are good. All the same, this meant I could start doing budgeting and working out my finances.</p><br><p>Finances are some scary shit. If I didn't know better I'd swear I'd die without a sizable chunk of money a year.  For now I'm still staying with my parents until summer (at their behest more than mine) and I'll find a place to live then.</p><br><p>I really am making enough to be okay. It's just that there's not a lot on the margins. I don't want a whole bunch of stuff. I just don't want to worry about suddenly needing money for any reason.</p><br><p>Anyway, the other struggle has been that of the triangle. I'm getting behind on my schoolwork and hoping to catch up by/over the weekend. And I was pretty distressed because I spent like 4 hours obsessing over <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_thm_1.12">exercise 1.12 in SICP</a>.</p><br><p>The problem is to write a procedure that computes the elements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle">Pascal's Triangle</a>.</p><br><p>That shouldn't be a big deal, you know? But I obsessed over it. And now I've got a silly over-engineered solution that I'm more fond of than I should be. It's an interesting problem though. Hopefully I've learned something from it.</p><br><p>Mine still isn't quite working and I know there is a simpler way to do it. I cracked after a while and read about how one might solve it but I didn't peek at any code. Still, I'm stuck on doing it <em>my way</em>. I'm such a bastard. Anyway, it's coming together and I expect it'll be done by the end of the hour. It'll be in the week 2 recap for sure.</p><br><p>Long story short I realized what I've gotten myself into today. And it's still where I want to be. It's just that I think it's going to take more work and time than I might have been able to understand.</p>
