I meant to post an entry about all sorts of nerdy and interesting computer things I've been reading but it's been delayed. I'll probably regret posting this but it's the first thing I've written poetry-wise since July. It was sort of an experience.<br><br>Fear<br><br>I want the biggest hug I have inside me to swallow you up,<br>Like the reals swallow the rationals.<br>I don't want to go back to the beginning,<br>I'd rather see forward to understand where<br>I'm going. The whence question is<br>imprecise and leads me down paths,<br>many with thorns,<br>and only more imprecise questions.<br><br>The waters remain muddy so I climb the ladder out<br>until I find myself in clouds, fluffy and inarticulate.<br>Floating amid a mass of almost fluid abstractions,<br>they leak rain all over my parade.<br>I want to be more than you,<br>encompass you,<br>surpass you.<br><br>I lost sight of God just over a distant moon.<br>I hope I didn't offend him, my absent-mindedness<br>is often misperceived. But his opinion is not my concern.<br>I must be ever mindful that even if I find him and think<br>God is everywhere, that my invention is my own and is fractal<br>...or homoiconic. I cannot trust myself.<br><br>I rode the solar winds further up to get a better view<br>but everything was opaque, only more black boxes. I<br>couldn't fathom how to measure the cardinality so I<br>counted off an Aleph One, resolved to return<br>once I was the wiser. Higher still then until I saw it.<br><br>Our patchwork universe was being held together by holes.<br>Dark holes which pulled at us as the drain does the droplets.<br>And this was too much for me.<br>I know my monkey brain is too small.<br><br>And then I saw you. I remembered, "A ha.<br>I''ve left my sphere." And I looked back<br>and saw it. I'm not sure how long it will last.<br><br>It didn't look like much. Small and dirty and ignorant.<br>But I saw a quiet room on a sunday flooded with light and you.<br><br>Maybe it will be enough.
