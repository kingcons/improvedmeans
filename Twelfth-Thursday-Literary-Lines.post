More Neruda today. He's good stuff. From his work, <em>Canto General</em>, X: The Fugitive:<br>"XII"<br>To all, to you<br>silent beings of the night<br>who took my hand in the darkness, to you,<br>lamps<br>of immortal light, star lines,<br>staff of life, secret brethren,<br>to all, to you,<br>I say: there's no giving thanks,<br>nothing can fill the wineglasses<br>of purity,<br>nothing can<br>contain all the sun in the invincible<br>springtime's flags,<br>like your quiet dignity.<br>I only<br>think<br>that I've perhaps been worthy of so much<br>simplicity, of a flower so pure,<br>that perhaps I'm you, that's right,<br>that bit of earth, flour, and song,<br>that natural batch that knows<br>whence it comes and where it belongs.<br>I'm not such a distant bell<br>or a crystal buried so deep<br>that you can't decipher, I'm just<br>people, hidden door, dark bread,<br>and when you welcome me, you welcome<br>yourself; that guest<br>repeatedly beaten<br>and repeatedly<br>reborn.<br>To all, to all,<br>to whomever I don't know, to whomever never<br>heard this name, to those who dwell<br>all along our long rivers,<br>at the foot of the volcanoes, in the sulfuric<br>shadow of copper, to fishermen and farmhands,<br>to blue Indians on the shores<br>of lakes sparkling like glass,<br>to the shoemaker who at this very hour questions,<br>nailing leather with ancient hands,<br>to you, to the one who unknowingly has awaited me,<br>I belong and acknowledge and sing.
