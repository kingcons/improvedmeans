These are a few of the things I've picked up from reddit or the blogosphere or elsewhere of late:<br><br>-A <a href="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:p3uapxFN_1IJ:math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/godelnagel.pdf+godelnagel&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us">paper on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem</a> and some contentions Nagel had with it.<br><br>-A <a href="http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:p3uapxFN_1IJ:math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/godelnagel.pdf+godelnagel&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us">transcript of a talk by Alan Cox</a> at a Linux Conference on why Brooks' Laws of Software Development don't hold up under the open source model.<br><br>-An <a href="http://blog.danmcweeney.com/50">interesting post by Dan McWeeny courtesy of James Governor</a> over at Redmonk on "Synthesizers" a posited new category of software developer.<br><br>-An <a href="http://sob.apotheon.org/?p=320">interesting essay on the problems of programming</a>.<br><br>-A <a href="http://blogs.teamb.com/craigstuntz/2007/10/26/37763">fantastic response to a recent article of Raganwald's about Object Oriented Programming</a> and the problems of information hiding. I especially like the leaning towards less stateful code.<br><br>-<a href="http://ifacethoughts.net/2007/10/19/learning-new-programming-languages//">Another good response to a Raganwald article, this time about learning new programming languages</a>. I've been going through this a bit myself lately with a recent Java assignment that I essentially tried to write in C. I need to be writing it in idiomatic Java but I'm lazy and don't like Java. I'm getting it together though.<br><br>-A <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3999952944619245780">Google Tech Talk on why the GIT source control repository should be used in lieu of any others</a>. This one is given by Randal Schwartz, it is not the already circulated talk by Linus Torvalds himself.<br><br>-An <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=351659">interview with Joe Armstrong</a>, creator of Erlang, on the future of programming, object orientation, and statefulness.<br><br>-A design philosophy. <a href="http://freeshells.ch/~revence/simple.txt">If it's not simple, it's wrong</a>.<br><br>-Finally, I also found podcasts from the recent <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2007/index.php?page=podcasts/">OOPSLA</a> and <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2007/speakers#RandallMunroe">ACM Reflections</a> conferences. Some of these would be <em>well</em> worth listening to.
