So, I'm really in the home stretch now. I'm spending all day today trying to get something like 7 pages written on Weapons of Mass Destruction which I painfully don't care about. I've finished and submitted all my other finals and assignment. It's the only thing left. I have to give a presentation with my group on some questions about China's specific stances with regards to WMDs on Tuesday and then we have a group ~25 page research paper to turn in Thursday. My group and I really want the 25 page paper wrapped up by Tuesday so we can just sit around between Tues. and Thurs. and then hand it in and walk away. Then I'm off for a bit. I'll probably whine about how one month isn't enough of a break in the near future. <br><br>I haven't managed to get to the skatepark this week or write much lisp. I have watched some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop">Cowboy Bebop</a> during evenings with Teresa and I've enjoyed it. It's also got me looking into the music of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Kanno">Yoko Kanno</a>. Which in turn is pushing me to try and start exploring Jazz. I've always put that off because it's a huge and rich genre...hell, I put off exploring a lot of older genres (Jazz, Classical, 60s and 70s pop and rock) for that reason. The depths seem too great to plumb. It's still good fun to try. Aside from skateboarding at brookrun, I hope to play videogames a bit, catch up with friends and finish a screencast of a lisp solution to project 2 in CS once my classes wrap up this week.<br><br>I've been positively eating it on my berrics predictions lately. <a href="http://theberrics.com/dailyopspost.php?postid=1179">At least Mark Appleyard won</a> today. I think that makes me 3 for 6. Round 1 and I'm already eating it. Awesome. I'll try to do a revision in the interlude between Round 1 and Round 2. I also hope I'll finally catch up on a <a href="http://trashed-ideas.net/">blog</a> <a href="http://krow684.livejournal.com/">or</a> <a href="http://justinthefunnyrobot.wordpress.com/">three</a> that I've had a hard time keeping up with. Hopefully, <a href="http://dongerz.livejournal.com/">Don</a> will start posting again too. It's like he's a ghost! What might he be up to these days? Later, folks.
