9 months into &quot;the real world&quot; I'm a bit perplexed. With all this talk of industry and full-time jobs, I for some reason expected that &quot;the real world&quot; would expect you to be industrious. Apparently, I am mistaken and while you'd want to end up at a job that challenges, drives and energizes you it is by no means a necessity. I've been thinking about this a lot and at some point will write more and possibly even wrap up that emerging philosophy series of posts. Particularly because I've been having lots of discussions that concern economics and/or politics lately and there seem to be some tenuous strands between those things. I go back and forth on what we need to do about the majority of people that accept and have no issue with the status quo, or at least lack the drive, energy or determination to get outside, above or beyond it. I would say that's probably 90% of us and am pretty sure I am in that category myself at present. It certainly seems unreasonable to demand the peak of human achievement from everyone and highly questionable whether people would universally like being at the peak of their potential achievement, or near it. I'll try to elaborate on those thoughts enough for them to be coherent in the near future.<br><br>Found some good reading\watching this morning though I sometimes wonder when\how\if I'll get to all of it. One good thing is the <a href="http://www.tele-task.de/page42_mode1_series653.html#">S3 2008 conference</a> (unrelated to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3">Amazon's S3 architecture</a> ) which includes <a href="http://www.tele-task.de/page50_lecture3621.html">video footage of a presentation</a> on the <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/">Lively Kernel</a> . That's pretty cool stuff and I hope I get a chance to watch it tonight. Also there was a paper co-authored by Pascal Costanza on <a href="http://p-cos.net/documents/s32008.pdf">Reflection in Programming Languages</a> , specifically Lisp. I've read the first few pages and though some of it is over my head I think I can stumble my way through it. I really am hoping to get around to reading this paper by David Wiley titled <a href="http://opencontent.org/docs/ososs.pdf"><em>Online Self-Organizing Social Systems: The Decentralized Future of Online Learning</em> </a> . Will referred it to me and it looks quite good. I'm even tempted to read <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD07xx/EWD750.html">some Dijkstra</a> .<br><br>I'm interested in getting some of the piano work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_Maurice_Ravel#Piano.28s.29">Ravel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Satie">Satie</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compositions_by_Claude_Debussy#Solo_piano_music">Debussy</a>. I have Debussy's Children's Corner and like that. Then again, maybe I just need more Masashi Hamauzu.<br><br> A final thought: Why are 90% of the good technical lectures on the web in RM format which I must tediously rip to download an offline copy? No, I do not trust your site to stay up with the content I want forever. Even if you're google or wikipedia. <a href="http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/ripping-and-encoding-streaming-rm-or-how-i-defeated-realplayer/">Thanks, Peter</a>.
