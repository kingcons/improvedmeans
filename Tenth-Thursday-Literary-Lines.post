Thursday Literary Lines<br>Today's piece is from the Neruda book that arrived while I was at the beach. It is titled Ars Poetica.<br><br>Between shadow and space, between trimmings and damsels,<br>Endowed with a singular heart and sorrowful dreams,<br>Precipitously pallid, withered in the brow<br>And with a furious widower's mourning for each day of life,<br>Ah, for each invisible water that I drink somnolently<br>And from every sound that I welcome trembling,<br>I have the same absent thirst and the same cold fever,<br>A nascent ear, an indirect anguish,<br>As if thieves or ghosts were coming,<br>And in a shell or fixed and profound expanse,<br>Like a humiliated waiter, like a slightly raucous bell,<br>Like an old mirror, like the smell of a solitary house<br>Where the guests come in at night wildly drunk,<br>And there is a smell of clothes thrown on the floor, and an absence of flowers-<br>Possibly in another even less melancholy way-<br>But the truth is that suddenly the wind that lashes my chest,<br>The nights of infinite substance fallen in my bedroom,<br>The noise of a day that burns with sacrifice,<br>Ask me mournfully what prophecy there is in me,<br>And there is a swarm of objects that call without being answered,<br>And a ceaseless movement, and a bewildered man.
