I am not opposed to it.<br>I lived fully and well,<br>spending time perched in<br>dogwoods and chairs to<br>try and learn the lessons<br>of machines, men and dogs<br>in their cacophonous chorus.<br><br>I am not opposed to it.<br>I eventually did settle<br>with my own thoughts<br>after years of combat.<br>I knew rebellion, fought<br>a long war and nurtured<br>a false hope. Thankfully<br>in the end my carapace<br>had been punctured.<br><br>I am not opposed to it<br>though I am weary of the<br>dignity and the chase.<br>Who are we to be so presumptuous?<br>Who are we to assume that in our<br>affairs we should be entitled to<br>the presentation, if not the<br>substance, for all our days?<br><br>I am not opposed to it<br>though nod to a fear and<br>hubris that is hard-argued<br>as judgment. Still, if for<br>a year I loved and loved well<br>then I need not keep those<br>cherished ones waiting.<br><br>I am not opposed to it.<br>I recognized early that time was<br>my valued asset and treated<br>it accordingly. I fought for<br>ground in a society enamored<br>with the ephemeral. I won.<br>Mistakes were made, the wrong<br>losses suffered and less than<br>the best gains accomplished.<br>But in the end, I stand by my time.
