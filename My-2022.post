Somehow it's already New Year's Eve. I've got two more days off but I'm already
distracted by work to do in January. So now seems like an ideal time to step
back and reflect on what happened in 2022, what I loved, and what I'll let go of
as I move forward. I also feel I should shout out
[Manuel Uberti's wrap up](https://manueluberti.eu/2022/12/22/my-2022.html) which
inspired me (and he has great posts on emacs).

#### Things to Celebrate

##### Traveling

I took a trip to see Aaron on Vancouver Island and then James in Santa Barbara.
They were two glorious and much needed weeks out of the house. While I wasn't
off the whole time, I was able to focus on spending time with people I love very
much and get myself out of a rut. In fact, I've made pilgrimages to go see James
and Rachel in California 4 or 5 times in the last 18 months. Yet to regret it.
Need to squeeze in a NYC trip next year to see Justin and Kelly and Roni.

##### Exercise

I started running in the summer. I've barely exercised for a decade. It wasn't
really intentional. I used to love skateboarding with Burke or around the
apartment complex. After Burke moved away and Norma and I settled down, it just
wasn't the same. I started running in the spring but had a hard time staying
motivated. In late October, I started going to a nearby spin class with Norma.
At first I thought it wasn't for me but here we are two months later and I love
it. I'm going 3-4 times a week, sometimes with Norma and sometimes on my own. It
feels wonderful to be pushing my body again and just get out of the house and move.

##### My Partner

I had some really wonderful experiences with Norma this year. We took a trip to
Austin to see dear friends. We took a week off together at the end of March and
just lounged about and went on lunch dates. We're doing spin together and early
in the year we made a different cookie recipe [every
weekend](https://redlinernotes.com/docs/baking.txt) for a few months. I feel
closer to her than I have before and in January we will have been dating 10
years. It's hard to believe but it's something I'm very happy about.

##### Family

I got closer to the Butlers. I've always had a ... tenuous relationship with
Dad's side of the family. In a lot of ways, I thought my relationship to them
was determined _by_ my relationship with my dad which has never been very good.
To a large degree, I still think of my step dad John as dad and I miss him
dearly. But I went to Uncle Eddie's funeral earlier this year and started to
realize that my relationship with the Butlers is just plain separate from my
relationship to Terry. I haven't figured out what I want to do with that but I'm
grateful for it. I also attended my niece Caroline's wedding and have gotten a
bit closer to my half-sister Renee between that and Terry's recent health issues.

##### Hacking

A few different things have brought me joy this year on the hacking front. I've
done effectively no programming for work now that I'm an Engineering Manager and
a year on I'm happy with that decision. I struggle to recognize and appreciate
my contributions as a manager because a lot of relational work ... doesn't
really seem like work to me. But that's a separate issue. On the hacking front,
there are 3 things I've really enjoyed this year:

1. [Advent of Code](https://kingcons.github.io/advent-of-code/)

   Most recently, I organized a slack channel at work (`#fun-advent-of-code`)
   where about 15 folks participated in daily slack threads working through and
   discussing the different puzzles posted over the month of December. I coded
   my solutions in Common Lisp and enjoyed getting practice playing with new
   libraries. While I didn't get quite as far as I wanted, I got further than in
   past years and really enjoyed the camaraderie of it. I also had a few
   particularly elegant solutions. More literate puzzle writeups to come!

2. [Streaming Clones](https://www.twitch.tv/king_cons)

   During my week off with Norma at the end of March, I knew I missed hacking so
   I wanted to try reworking my emulator. Working alone in the garage is
   discouraging for me. I like having people to discuss my projects with. So I
   decided to take a risk and stream a rewrite of my NES emulator from scratch
   on twitch. I made a ton of progress and while I stopped at the end of July
   and some bugs remain. Super Mario Bros is playable and the codebase is
   generally in good shape. I got a lot of joy from this.

3. [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~kingcons)

   I started paying for Sourcehut and hosting my emulator hacking there early in
   the year. Drew Devault seems a bit divisive but I have a lot of appreciation
   for the way he has built sourcehut and the principled stance it takes on
   prioritizing open source and community-oriented projects over for-profit
   corporate software. I have greatly enjoyed being a user of this service.

##### Records and VOTD

My favorite hack of the year wasn't Advent or Clones. It was actually a bit of
emacs lisp I wrote in under an hour to help me randomly pick music to play on my
twitch stream from my record collection. The satisfaction of hitting Super+N and
being shown album art of a record to play is hard to beat. I've been purchasing
most of my music on bandcamp or discogs. As someone who enjoys archiving or
curating things in general, this has been a lot of fun. The current library and
VOTD code lives [here](https://github.com/kingcons/dotemacs/blob/master/init/votd.el).

#### Things to Come

I'd love to do a separate post about some cultural things I enjoyed in 2022.
Favorite TV, movies, music, that sort of thing. There are also some things I'd
like to change in 2023 and pieces of myself I'd like to work on. But for now,
I'll close with a few things I'm looking forward to.

Norma and I are finally going on our honeymoon. We'll be going to Morocco for 2
weeks in March. I can't wait. I've never traveled overseas with Norma and I
think it'll be a wonderful time.

The final Strangeloop is happening and I'll be going with James and also a
wonderful former Iron Yard instructor, Tim. Strangeloop is always a great
conference and St Louis is always a great adventure. This time will be no
different.

Last but not least, Aaron is coming to Atlanta at some point. I've been hoping
to take Aaron to some of my favorite local haunts, and Kimball House in
particular, for years so I can't wait for him to visit. We're gonna have a
blast.

For now, I'm grateful that I made it through the crazy year, that Calendly has
been a good place for me to grow in my career, and that I'm as close to my
beautiful partner as I've ever been. Here's hoping that 2023 is an opportunity
to have more adventures, grow healthier, and learn something new. Cheers. ðŸ¥‚
