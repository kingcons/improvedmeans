Yesterday's post did quite well on reddit and my server handled the traffic as well so that's nice. Expect more details and thoughts on "The Concurrency Problem" as well as a general update tomorrow.<br><br>As for today, it's more Neruda. Today's poem is titled <em>I Will Return</em>, from his work "The Stones of Chile".<br><br>Some other time, man or woman, traveler,<br>later, when I am not alive,<br>look here, look for me<br>between stone and ocean,<br>in the light storming<br>through the foam.<br>Look here, look for me,<br>for here I will return, without saying a thing,<br>without voice, without mouth, pure,<br>here I will return to be the churning<br>of the water, of<br>its unbroken heart,<br>here, I will be discovered and lost:<br>here, I will, perhaps, be stone and silence.
