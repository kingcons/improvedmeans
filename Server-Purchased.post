Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>A small update for you. I have, as previously announced, registered redlinernotes.com for one year. Previous efforts to get some old hardware together to host/serve the site did not work as planned so I just purchased a server from "pricewatch.com". You can see it <a href="http://www.pcdirectsource.com/Item.cfm?ID=2130">here</a>. It's pretty impressive what you can get shipped to your house for $120. Granted there's no monitor, keyboard, or mouse but once the server is up and hosting you don't need them. Anyway, the server is probably overkill for the amount of load/traffic my site will generate but considering the next cheapest thing was half as powerful and only would've saved me $20 I think I made the right call. Expect the site up by next friday...I'll keep you posted.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Editor-In-Chief
