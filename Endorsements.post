This wasn't on my list of things to post about tonight but...here I am anyway. Everyone seems to be writing an endorsement but I won't write my own. Many others have expressed my views in a much more elegant prose than I could muste. I will be voting for Obama tomorrow though and I'd like to note a few of the endorsements I've read which I felt were significant.<br><br><a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/11/barack-obama-fo.html">Andrew Sullivan</a><br><a href="http://www.politico.com/arena/perm/Cass_R__Sunstein_BDDDA786-0C3A-44E4-B22C-6FA964EB6199.html"> Cass Sunstein</a><br><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/10/why-i-support-barack-obama.html">Tim O'Reilly</a><br><a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-endorsements-2008/esquire-endorses-barack-obama?click=main_sr">Esquire</a><br><a href="http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12516666&amp;source=features_box_main">The Economist</a><br><br>Those meant something to me and have had some influence in my own decision. I'm not trying to sway anyone at this late date but I did want to make a statement of my own beliefs and thoughts on the matter, even if they're a scattered amalgamation of others thoughts.
