It's been a long time since I've read poetry, as I related to a friend recently. I've wanted to get back to it and so poked through two volumes given to me by friends who know my love of poetry. I absolutely have to post one of the poems I read. The poem is taken from the book <b>Good Poems</b>, given to me by Don Gerz on my 22nd birthday. It was compiled by Garrison Keillor. It's called <em>To be of use</em> by Marge Piercy taken from p. 157. It's really outstanding. Someday I hope I work as well as those depicted...and find work as worth doing as that described.<br><br><blockquote><br>The people I love the best<br>jump into work head first<br>without dallying in the shallows<br>and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.<br>They seem to become natives of that element,<br>the black sleek heads of seals<br>bouncing like half-submerged balls.<br><br>I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,<br>who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,<br>who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,<br>who do what has to be done, again and again.<br><br>I want to be with people who submerge<br>in the task, who go into the fields to harvest<br>and work in a row and pass the bags along,<br>who are not parlor generals and field deserters<br>but move in a common rhythm<br>when the food must come in or the fire be put out.<br><br>The work of the world is common as mud.<br>Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.<br>But the thing worth doing well done<br>has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.<br>Greek amphoras for wine or oil,<br>Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums<br>but you know they were made to be used.<br>The pitched cries for water to carry<br>and a person for work that is real.
