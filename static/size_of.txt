The following stats were obtained through a mixture of sloccount
on recent checkouts (sbcl, luajit, tcc, etc) and ohloh.net pages.

minimal developer footprint:
15M linux kernel
09M firefox ;; chrome is bigger!
03.5M virtualbox
02M llvm/clang
02M emacs ;; vim is bigger!
01M x.org server
00.4M sbcl ;; python is twice the size (batteries included, of course)
00.4M git
00.2M bash
00.1M slime
00.05M openssh
00.04M openbox
;; this doesn't take into account servers, android/3g and distributed systems you rely on
;; frankly, let's not even go there.
;; the opengenera torrent floating around =~ 870k

-- total: 34.14M loc
;; so, has a desktop OS doubled in size 5 times in the last 2 decades?

compilers:
lua (written in c) - 15k
tcc (written in c) - 65k -- output 1/3-1/2[*] the speed of gcc's output
luajit (written in c) - 75k
rust (written in rust) - 250k
sbcl (written in lisp) - 350k ;; ccl is a bit smaller
gcc (written in c) - 6.1M
[*] - do not trust benchmarks! http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2005-09/msg00054.html
also of note, uemacs (used by linus torvalds) - 13.5k
