I have learned that Montana is<br>a lonely state. Filled with that beauty<br>which could only belong to abject desolation.<br>They tell me it is the fastest<br>growing county in the state. And here<br>I can more clearly pick out:<br>the howling on the wind,<br>the tracks of my pursuers,<br>and the flock that will follow.<br>What is it, I wonder, that draws us<br>together in our loneliness? Is it some<br>incomprehensible wonder at an unceasing<br>orderless motion? I no longer search<br>the skies for a conductor. My search more often<br>turns inward. And there, clockwork reigns.<br>A silent oscillation between misanthropy<br>and optimism. A confusion at the whispered words<br>of justice. And no sense whatsoever<br>of how through it all a warm hearth is found.<br>And home.<br><br>By chance I left Neruda at home, whom<br>Yevtushenko reminded me of. By chance I found<br>that slumbering desire to be everyone, sense<br>everything, and connect with the ineffable essence<br>of the world. And though I may never<br>make peace with this curse of oneness I<br>am confident that there lies in wait for me<br>some richness to call mine that shall not fade.<br><br>But I am also unsure any of us<br>are deserving of such a future when<br>I see:<br>our capacity for insular obstinance,<br>our apparent lack of stewardship,<br>or our bottomless apathy, mindless consumerism,<br>moral ambivalence, and<br>petty categorical divisions<br>into imagined communities.<br><br>What will it take to stimulate interest<br>and invoke participation in the human<br>cause? Or shall we continue on as an inert<br>public, a chemical cesspool acting out the<br>steps of a process written long ago?
