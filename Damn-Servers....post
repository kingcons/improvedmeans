It's been a good while since I posted last. After meaning to do it for months, I've finally migrated to a new web server. I'm self-hosting so I have no one to yell at about everything taking so long but myself. At any rate, I've migrated my Desktop, Server and Laptop from Ubuntu Linux to the <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=697">custom Arch Linux build</a> I've been working on lately. Some old links in old posts are broken at the moment but I'm hoping to repair them in the coming weeks.<br><br>For now, I'm just glad this thing is back up and functioning after the week of chaos. I'm <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/code">still committing code</a> as regularly as I can and for the first time in a long time <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/jukebox">Redline Radio</a> is live again as well. Let me know if you're interested in getting access. We will now return to the regular posting schedule. :-)
