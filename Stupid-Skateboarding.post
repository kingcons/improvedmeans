The last week has positively flown by. I'm being much less productive than I hoped to be with my month off but I can tell that I need it. My batteries were pretty drained after the last 7 months. On some level it's disappointing but for now I'm enjoying the vacation.<br><br>I injured my wrist skateboarding Tuesday evening and am recuperating fairly well. Seems like a serious bruise or a mild sprain to me. Hopefully I'll be over it soon. That's contributed somewhat to my coding slowdown.<br><br>Other than that, I've done well on my battle of the berrics predictions for the last week. I did try <a href="http://funtoo.org/">Funtoo</a> in a VM but may replace my <a href="http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">OSx86</a> install with it for fun sometime in the near future. We'll see.<br><br>Oh, and Palm and Apple are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/948ee/palm_plays_catandmouse_with_apple_reenables/">still</a> <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2009/07/24/palm-complains-about-apple-to-usb-governing-body-while-pre-it/">at war</a>. It's just darling.<br><br>More news on all this in just a few days...
