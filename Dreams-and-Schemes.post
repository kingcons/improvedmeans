Of late, I'm not sure what I aspire to.<br><br>There are things that I'm certainly interested in and want to do. I also really would like to have a fairly deep understanding of computing and a good ability to program.<br><br>It's funny. I have a feeling the way you end up great is by not trying to be great. I have a feeling you end up being great by not caring about greatness too much and just doing what you love. And I'm still not sure how much I love programming. I'm certainly unsure I love being taught it. But I've always preferred self-teaching with computers.<br><br>Your thoughts?
