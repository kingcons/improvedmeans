Okay, I'd like to start by saying that Folk Implosion's One Part Lullaby is <em>such</em> a good album and I'd really forgotten that.<br><br>That being said, I'm just notifying readers not to expect the Friday Linux Lessons anymore. I've sort of...missed posting them the last two weeks due to crazy events but I've also sort of run out of steam.<br><br>Consider yourself notified. If you want me to write a Linux Lesson or help you with computer questions please tell me. This even extends to Windows and Mac users and covers questions like "Brit, how do you manage to pirate everything ever?" Just ask and I'll be more than happy to answer.<br><br>Fridays are now Q&amp;A days. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays may or may not see changes soon. I'll keep you posted.
