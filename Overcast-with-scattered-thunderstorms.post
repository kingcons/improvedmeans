Today is my 25th birthday. So far I've mostly done chores: grocery shopping, laundry, handing over the keys to my old apartment, odds and ends. And, by design, I don't have any social plans for this afternoon or evening. I'm usually pretty pensive and melancholy around my birthday. This year continues the trend. Generally, when my birthday is coming up I think, "Okay. You've gotten this far and accomplished this much. Maybe it wasn't all you wanted but at least you're further than last year. What's next?" Not the best party conversation. :)<br><br>In all fairness, it's been a good year. I finally finished my undergrad degree, got my first job as a professional programmer (a damn good job at that), and moved into an apartment with <a href="http://twitter.com/burkehramsey">one of my oldest and dearest friends</a>. That said, I've been struggling a lot lately. A large part of that is because I don't know what I want for myself anymore or what my goals are. Personal relationships both romantic and otherwise, career ambitions and hobbies all seem up in the air. It's had me feeling pretty mixed up. I can't say I'm terribly proud of where I am at 25. Oh, well. I'll certainly enjoy taking some time off this winter to try and sort through things more. At least I've had fun hacking on <a href="http://vintage-digital.com/hefner/software/shuffletron/">Andy Hefner's Shuffletron</a> (a Common Lisp command line app, something I have <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=30242">*some* experience</a> with...) music player lately. The <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/shuffletron/commits/playlists">main changes so far</a> have been to add playlists and a long TODO file. It's a fun diversion until I get ever so slightly more acclimated to my professional coding life and come up with a serious project that will push me more.<br><br>It's been hard to post lately for two reasons. The first is that I've simply been busy. The second is that I haven't had much to say. My thoughts are jumbled. The same thing happened <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/On-my-birthday.html">last year</a> and like last year I'm going to borrow some of the words of my favorite poet, <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?cat=24">Czeslaw Milosz</a>. Wherever you are, thanks for reading this far and I hope the sun is bright and your world is well.<br><br><h3><b>Conversations with Jeanne</b></h3><br><br>Let us not talk philosophy, drop it, Jeanne.<br>So many words, so much paper, who can stand it.<br>I told you the truth about distancing myself.<br>I've stopped worrying about my misshapen life.<br>It was no better and no worse than the usual human tragedies.<br><br>For over thirty years we have been waging our dispute<br>As we do now, on the island under the skies of the tropics.<br>We flee a downpour, in an instant the bright sun again,<br>And I grow dumb, dazzled by the emerald essence of the leaves.<br><br>We submerge in foam at the line of the surf,<br>We swim far, to where the horizon is a tangle of banana bush,<br>With little windmills of palms.<br>And I am under accusation: That I am not up to my oeuvre,<br>That I do not demand enough from myself,<br>As I could have learned from Karl Jaspers,<br>That my scorn for the opinions of this age grows slack.<br><br>I roll on a wave and look at white clouds.<br><br>You are right, Jeanne, I don't know how to care about the salvation of my soul.<br>Some are called, others manage as well as they can.<br>I accept it, what has befallen me is just.<br>I don't pretend to the dignity of a wise old age.<br>Untranslatable into words, I chose my home in what is now,<br>In things of this world, which exist and, for that reason, delight us:<br>Nakedness of women on the beach, coppery cones of their breasts,<br>Hibiscus, alamanda, a red lily, devouring<br>With my eyes, lips, tongue.<br>Guava juice, the juice of <em>la prune de Cythere</em>,<br>Rum with ice and syrup, lianas-orchids<br>In a rain forest, where trees stand on the stilts of their roots.<br><br>Death you say, mine and yours, closer and closer,<br>We suffered and this poor earth was not enough.<br>The purple-black earth of vegetable gardens<br>Will be here, either looked at or not.<br>The sea, as today, will breathe from its depths.<br>Growing small, I disappear in the immense, more and more free.
