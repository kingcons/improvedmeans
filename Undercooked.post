I was never comfortable talking<br>about the soul of my generation.<br>I often feel I'm just growing<br>acquainted with them before<br>I decide there is no soul,<br>no essence. Never was.<br><br>Souls are just peculiarities, after all.<br>And I had to give up on undecidable<br>problems some years back.<br>The unknowable held my head<br>underwater until I relented, suffocating.<br><br>But I've been baring and burying bits<br>of my soul since I've been here.<br>I lost some to a splinter. And the hand<br>I squeezed as it was removed piece by piece.<br>I bared it to a pastor who I doubt understood<br>why I found myself so insufficient.<br><br>I left some with a drunk girl who taught<br>me compassion, a faithful girl who taught me<br>guilt, one made of tornadoes who forced me<br>to take a chance and another still who<br>showed me what it feels like to make<br>a home inside someone else.<br><br>I squandered some on drugs. Drugs which<br>stole from me both time and memory.<br>Crashing around inside my brain in<br>endless chemical nuptials.<br>Tweak. Tweak.<br><br>I spread this thing in bits, countless bits,<br>scattered on platters, fragments<br>littered along buses, planes, cars, trains,<br>in terminals and ports not of this world.<br><br>My soul is in all these places, hidden<br>or in plain view. I can't tell you<br>what it means. Or if there's meaning,<br>anyway. I only know that's how it happened.<br>Here I am. Where to next?
