I've done a very poor job adhering to my schedule today. I'm still in the spring break mentality and not really wanting to work. I worked hard Monday and Tuesday. I'm not sure what happened today. At any rate, I need to remember to make myself write some Lisp, Haskell, or Python for fun this weekend. I should also probably write some C# for school.<br><br>Three quick things I stumbled on today that made me happy:<br><a href="http://funcall.blogspot.com/2009/03/fast-forward-to-1985.html">Joe Marshall continuing to talk about his history with lisp</a>, how he found it, etc.<br><br><a href="http://piumarta.net/software/lib6502/">lib6502 by Ian Piumarta</a>. I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1084y/ask_reddit_what_is_your_favorite_cpu_instruction/">keep hearing that the 6502 had a really nice ISA</a> and I'm considering whether an eventual fun project (like 5 or more years out) might be to write a basic lisp or scheme interpreter targeting the 6502. Maybe I could get away with working on it some in an Architecture or Programming Language Concepts course. Somehow it sounds tricky/crazy. Could I write one in 5 months? I'm still an idiot. Maybe I won't be in a year or so.<br><br>Last, there's some interesting guitar modeling software for PC...and articles about how to emulate other people's guitar setups, <a href="http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/how-to-capture-john-mayers-gui/">including John Mayer</a>. Now, that may sound ridiculous...but here's something else that makes me happy that not many people know. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruMX0GrvwAI">John Mayer can play the everloving shit out of his guitar</a>. There are a lot of little Stevie-isms in there. As in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan">late great</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWLw7nozO_U">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a>, whom I dearly love. Is there anyone besides Mayer that's keeping the SRV style alive today that I should know about?<br><br>I'm still more interested in sampling than being a guitarist myself but I like to noodle now and again. Speaking of which, go back and listen to the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/Gorillaz">first Gorillaz album</a>. Great, right? :)
