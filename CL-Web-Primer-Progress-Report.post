Wow. It's been way too long since I've written about this. Naturally, software takes longer than expected. I also helped Leslie test features that were in beta so migrating to those and working out their kinks slowed things down a little.<br><br>But long story short, the next entry in the CL Web Primer series should be coming very soon. 7 days at the latest. If you just want to read the code, it's at <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/clockwork">http://github.com/redline6561/clockwork</a>.<br><br>Defining a <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/clockwork/blob/master/src/calendar.lisp">jQueryUI Datepicker presentation</a>, 38 lines.<br>Defining a <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/clockwork/blob/master/src/messaging.lisp">simple text messaging system</a>, 37 lines.<br>Defining <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/clockwork/blob/master/src/reminder.lisp">a reminder class and methods to schedule the reminder to be sent, send it and delete it</a>, 47 lines.<br>Defining a <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/clockwork/blob/master/src/forms.lisp">form for users to fill out, a list of timezones and validation functions to ensure the input is good</a>, 109 lines.<br><a href="https://github.com/redline6561/clockwork/blob/master/src/init-session.lisp">Putting it all together</a>, 27 lines.<br>Learning about web programming (I know, giving myself too much credit there...) with Common Lisp and <a href="http://weblocks.viridian-project.de/">Weblocks</a>? Priceless.<br><br><a href="http://clockwork.redlinernotes.com/">The site is still quite ugly</a> and <a href="https://github.com/redline6561/clockwork/blob/master/TODO">needs a lot of work</a> and a few more features but at least it's functional now.<br>Until next time...
