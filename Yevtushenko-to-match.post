<p><i>I would like</i> by Yevgeny Yevtushenko</p><br><code>I would like<br>            to be born<br>                      in every country,<br>have a passport<br>               for them all<br>to throw<br>        all foreign offices<br>                           into panic,<br>be every fish<br>             in every ocean<br>and every dog<br>             in the streets of the world.<br>I don’t want to bow down<br>                        before any idols<br>or play at being<br>                a Russian Orthodox church hippie,<br>but I would like to plunge<br>                          deep into Lake Baikal<br>and surface snorting<br>                    somewhere,<br>                              why not in the Mississippi?<br>In my damned beloved universe<br>                             I would like<br>to be a lonely weed,<br>                    but not a delicate Narcissus<br>kissing his own mug<br>                   in the mirror.<br>I would like to be<br>                  any of God’s creatures<br>right down to the last mangy hyena--<br>but never a tyrant<br>                  or even the cat of a tyrant.<br>I would like to be<br>                  reincarnated as a man<br>                                       in any image:<br>a victim of prison tortures,<br>a homeless child in the slums of Hong Kong,<br>a living skeleton in Bangladesh,<br>a holy beggar in Tibet,<br>a black in Cape Town,<br>but never<br>         in the image of Rambo.<br>The only people whom I hate<br>                           are the hypocrites--<br>pickled hyenas<br>              in heavy syrup.<br>I would like to lie<br>                   under the knives of all the surgeons in the world,<br>be hunchbacked, blind,<br>                      suffer all kinds of diseases,<br>                                                   wounds and scars,<br>be a victim of war,<br>                   or a sweeper of cigarette butts,<br>just so a filthy microbe of superiority<br>                                       doesn’t creep inside.<br>I would not like to be in the elite,<br>nor, of course,<br>               in the cowardly herd,<br>nor be a guard dog of that herd,<br>nor a shepherd,<br>               sheltered by that herd.<br>And I would like happiness,<br>                           but not at the expense of the unhappy,<br>and I would like freedom,<br>                         but not at the expense of the unfree.<br>I would like to love<br>                    all the women in the world,<br>and I would like to be a woman, too--<br>                                     just once...<br>Men have been diminished<br>                        by Mother Nature.<br>Why couldn’t we give motherhood<br>                               to men?<br>If an innocent child<br>                    stirred<br>                           below his heart,<br>man would probably<br>                  not be so cruel.<br>I would like to be man’s daily bread--<br>say,<br>    a cup of rice<br>                 for a Vietnamese woman in mourning,<br>cheap wine<br>          in a Neapolitan workers’ trattoria,<br>or a tiny tube of cheese<br>                        in orbit round the moon.<br>Let them eat me,<br>                let them drink me,<br>only let my death<br>                 be of some use.<br>I would like to belong to all times,<br>                                    shock all history so much<br>that it would be amazed<br>                       what a smart aleck I was.<br>I would like to bring Nefertiti<br>                               to Pushkin in a troika.<br>I would like to increase<br>                        the space of a moment<br>                                             a hundredfold,<br>so that in the same moment<br>                          I could drink vodka with fishermen in Siberia<br>and sit together with Homer,<br>                            Dante,<br>                                  Shakespeare,<br>                                              and Tolstoy,<br>drinking anything,<br>                  except, of course,<br>                                    Coca-Cola,<br>--dance to the tom-toms in the Congo,<br>--strike at Renault,<br>--chase a ball with Brazilian boys<br>                                  at Copacabana Beach.<br>I would like to know every language,<br>                                like the secret waters under the earth,<br>and do all kinds of work at once.<br>                                 I would make sure<br>that one Yevtushenko was merely a poet,<br>                                 the second--an underground fighter<br>                                                             somewhere,<br>I couldn’t say where<br>                    for security reasons,<br>the third--a student at Berkeley,<br>                                 the fourth--a jolly Georgian drinker,<br>and the fifth--<br>               maybe a teacher of Eskimo children in Alaska,<br>the sixth--<br>       a young president,<br>                    somewhere, say, modestly speaking, in Sierra Leone,<br>the seventh--<br>             would still be shaking a rattle in his stroller,<br>and the tenth...<br>                the hundredth...<br>                                the millionth...<br>For me it’s not enough to be myself,<br>                                    let me be everyone!<br>Every creature<br>              usually has a double,<br>but God was stingy<br>                  with the carbon paper,<br>and in his Paradise Publishing Corporation<br>                                          made a unique copy of me.<br>But I shall muddle up<br>                     all God’s cards--<br>                                      I shall confound God!<br>I shall be in a thousand copies to the end of my days,<br>so that the earth buzzes with me,<br>                                 and computers go berserk<br>in the world census of me.<br>I would like to fight on all your barricades,<br>                                             humanity,<br>dying each night<br>                like an exhausted moon,<br>and resurrecting each morning<br>                             like a newborn sun,<br>with an immortal soft spot--fontanel--<br>                                      on my head.<br>And when I die,<br>               a smart-aleck Siberian Francois Villon,<br>do not lay me in the earth<br>                          of France<br>                                   or Italy,<br>but in our Russian, Siberian earth,<br>                                   on a still-green hill,<br>where I first felt<br>                  that I was<br>                            everyone.<br><br></code>
