At long last, this year is drawing to a close. I've ended my semester on a mostly positive note and am looking forward to the Christmas holidays. Why you ask? Well, for a few reasons.<br><br>There are people to catch up and hang out with. I've got books to read: A Deepness in Sky and maybe Diaspora. There may be some light video gaming between FFXII and Borderlands. But mostly, I have projects. I need to dive in to the code I'll be working with on my internship next semester...but not just to get a head start. The company I'll be working with is working on some pretty cool stuff and there are plenty of places where even a naive fellow like myself could be of help, provided I don't get in people's hair/workflow too much. I want to try to get a <a href="http://gitorious.org/paktahn">Paktahn</a> release out by Christmas with Leslie. That means giving a good read through of the analysis of <a href="http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=667471#p667471">why SBCL's PKGBUILD fails on x86_64</a>, fixing it and getting the result to juergen. Also for Paktahn, I want to start work on a branch using Unix-options for CLI argument handling and look over/improve a proxy branch I've been working on. Maybe a unit tests branch, as well. Besides that I have some programming books I'd like to read a bit of (and you <em><strong>have</strong></em><strong> </strong>to do the exercises!) and various other small projects to toy with.<br><br>All that has to wait until at least tomorrow though. I'm taking today off to be with <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/images/she_is_hardcore.jpg">my girlfriend</a> and relax a bit. She leaves Sunday at which point I'll go full into project-mode, I expect. :)<br><br>There's probably more to say here but I'm forgetting whatever it is...and my rice is ready. Cheers.
