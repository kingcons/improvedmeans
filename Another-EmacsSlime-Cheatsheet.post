<p style="text-align: left;">I've been picking up more and more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs">Emacs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIME">SLIME</a> while working my way through <a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> over the last week or two. I'm really happy with it as a work environment at this point but have tons left to learn. I haven't even written any elisp code to script it. Of course, I haven't had a need yet. I'll get there and I'll update this as I learn new things. I'll just note that I'm also quite attached to ArchLinux as my distro and, increasingly, Xmonad as my window manager. It's the first time I've felt really settled on an Operating System/environment since moving to Linux. Maybe ever. I'm pretty happy about it and aside from using <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/RedLinux-released.html">RedLinux</a> as a way to see what I like, I've posted all the config files <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/docs/redlinux/">here</a>. Before the cheatsheet here's a <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/shell/jobz5.html">quick Linux tip on killing processes</a> I found. Try passing -1 or -9 to kill along with the PID. Try -1 first then -9 if all else fails. On to the cheatsheet.<br><br>EDIT: Yes, it's ugly. Piss off. I miss monospaced fonts already, I'm grumpy, I'm tired, it's 1:40 am and I haven't been up this late in forever. I'll fix it later. ;-P</p><br>;;Emacs Cheatsheet:<br><br>; C-7                         Undo.<br>; C-8                         Backspace.<br>; C-s                          I-search forward.<br>; C-v                          Page-down<br>; M-v                         Page-up<br>; M-&lt;                        Beginning of document/file.<br>; M-&gt;                        End of document/file.<br>; C-l                          Center screen on cursor.<br>; C-n                         Next-line/Down-arrow<br>; C-p                         Previous-line/Up-arrow<br>; M-f                         Forward a word<br>; M-b                         Backward a word<br>; M-bksp                    Delete previous word.<br>; C-k                         Send a line to the kill ring.
