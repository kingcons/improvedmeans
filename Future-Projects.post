I'm looking to make a "You might be an Oglethorpe Kid if..." list. Any suggestions?<br><br>I was driving to Oglethorpe Friday night and after seeing a license plate ("ADD 7018" I think...) I had this interesting idea for a function:<br><br>1. Takes an integer (i.e. 7018) as it's single argument.<br><br>2.  Converts it to a list of integers (i.e. {7, 0, 1, 8}).<br><br>3. Adds the head of the list to the concatenated integer of the tail (i.e. 7 + 018).<br><br>4. Repeat until it's a 1 digit value and return that value.<br><br>So, on the first run you'd wind up with 025, then 25, then 7. Notice anything interesting? That's the first integer in the list. I'd like to write another function that runs the first million numbers through this function and then outputs the results in a nice readable table. That'd be interesting.<br><br>Anyway, in other news if you check I've updated the <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/">frontpage</a> on my site to be a bit more accurate with regards to my current activities. I also started categorizing all my old blog entries back in January and I'm done so now everything is tagged and you can pull up stuff by topic. Say if you wanted to read all my <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?cat=28">bad poetry</a> for example. Or my crazy <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?cat=48">essays</a>, all my rants involving <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?cat=9">Linux</a>, or posts with <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?cat=33">Pictures</a>, etc. Of course, the search function always works too.<br><br>I watched Lecture 2-a of the <a href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">SICP Lectures</a> last night. The first half hour made sense but the half hour after that was more like the sound of my brain melting. I'm going to try a few of the problems and see how it goes. I also might work on some goofy playlists. If you've got some goofy playlist\artist\song you've been rocking out to recently post it in the comments. Alright, wish me luck.
