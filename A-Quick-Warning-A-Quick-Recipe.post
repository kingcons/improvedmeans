You will probably be bombarded by a deluge of catch up blog posts/linkposts from me tonight. Sorry. That said, I made something for dinner tonight which was cheap, quick and reasonably tasty (i.e. not <em>tooo</em> bad). I made servings for two and I don't have measurements on anything but what the hell.<br><br>Salad:<br>Three handfuls of Baby Arugula<br>1 Chopped Pear<br>Four or Five Palmfuls of Shredded Asiago Cheese<br>Magical Paul Newman's Olive Oil and Vinegar<br>Mix/toss with fork and serve.<br><br>Entree:<br>Some form of noodles (I used spaghetti)<br>16 or so oz of Alfredo Sauce (I used Classico Four Cheese)<br>1 Chopped Chicken Breast sauteed with a healthy coating of Lemon Pepper.<br><br>Cold water or some Smirnoff Ice variant to drink. Vanilla Ice Cream with blueberries for dessert.<br><br>Simple, cheap, yum.
