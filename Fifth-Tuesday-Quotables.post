Dear Friends:<br>Sorry if I've been bad about responding to comments or e-mails for the past 24 hours or so. Today's been very busy. In fact, after this quick break to keep up my summer blog series I'm going to get back to working on something so that our servers at work will finally go up tomorrow. I'd also like to thank everyone for the tremendous response and support I got on my "Real World" post. It really did mean a lot.<br><br>"<font face="verdana" size="2">As a thirteen-year-old kid, I didn't have much more experience of the world than what I saw immediately around me. The warped little world we lived in was, I thought, <em>the world.</em> The world seemed cruel and boring, and I'm not sure which was worse." - Paul Graham</font><br><br><font face="verdana" size="2">"As far as I can tell, the concept of the hormone-crazed teenager is coeval with suburbia. I don't think this is a coincidence. I think teenagers are driven crazy by the life they're made to lead. Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere." - Paul Graham</font><br><br><font face="verdana" size="2">"To the popular press, "hacker" means someone who breaks into computers.  Among programmers it means a good programmer. But the two meanings are connected.  To programmers, "hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wantsâ€”whether the computer wants to or not. To add to the confusion, the noun "hack" also has two senses.  It can be either a compliment or an insult.  It's called a hack when you do something in an ugly way.  But when you do something so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also called a hack.  The word is used more often in the former than the latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more common than brilliant ones. Believe it or not, the two senses of "hack" are also connected.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the rules.  And there is a gradual continuum between rule breaking that's merely ugly (using duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space)." - Paul Graham</font><br><font face="verdana" size="2"><br>"It says a great deal about our work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution.   When we cook one up we're not always 100% sure which kind it is.  But as long as it has the right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign. It's odd that people think of programming as precise and methodical.  <em>Computers</em> are precise and methodical.  Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh." - Paul Graham<br></font>
