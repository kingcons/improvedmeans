Wow. I have been thinking about <em>The Concurrency Problem</em> waaaayyy too much the last 48 hours or so. I'm coming around about STM and am really hoping I get an e-mail back from Tim Sweeney answering some questions I had. Yes, <em>that</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Sweeney_(game_developer)">Tim Sweeney</a>.<br><br>All the same, I'd rather Erlang or some other message passing functional+concurrent programming model get adopted than a non message-passing model such as Haskell. Erlang just seems cleaner to me. I just like it a bit better. Perhaps that will all change as I actually start trying to write code with them (Erlang, Haskell). Anyone who feels like coming along and writing something better that has the advantages of both without the disadvantages of either feel free. What I'm trying to say is, feel free to invent NBL.<br><br>Okay, here's what I've been reading:<br>http://www.algorithm.com.au/talks/concurrency-erlang/<br>http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/<br>http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2007_02_04_patricklogan_archive.html<br>http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1277<br>http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2048#comment-25151<br>http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/07/Concurrency<br>http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/archive/2007/08/13/323<br>http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/archive/2007/02/08/191<br>http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/08/phat_data.html<br>http://tech.puredanger.com/2007/08/14/concurrency-terracotta/<br>http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/ralph/blogView?showComments=true&amp;printTitle=Erlang,_the_next_Java&amp;entry=3364027251<br>http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/concurrency.html<br>http://yarivsblog.com/articles/2006/08/16/why-erlang-is-a-great-language-for-concurrent-programming<br>And of course, the thing that started it all:<br>http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm
