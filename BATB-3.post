Battle at the Berrics 3 is coming up. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_%22S.K.A.T.E.%22">game of Skate</a> between some of the worlds best skateboarders. For those of you who don't know what Skate is, it's like Horse in Basketball except you spell Skate and battle over skateboarding tricks rather than shots from various parts of the court.<br><br>As I said, this is BATB 3. BATB <a href="http://theberrics.com/batb.php">1</a> and <a href="http://theberrics.com/batb2.php">2</a> were both awesome and had some of the most ridiculous and consistent skating I've ever seen, particularly in the finals and semis. Consequentially, trying to predict who is going to win is totally ridiculous. Barring the possibility of injuries or other nonsense, the finals are just as likely to be decided by somebody having a really off day as anything else. I mean, take Mike Mo vs Torey Pudwill for example. Is *anyone* excited to call that? All the same, here is my preliminary bracket. I'll try to figure out the semi-finals and finals later. Also, if you feel like debating these picks feel free to let me know where I'm way off. Even though I'm not. I've seen the future people.
