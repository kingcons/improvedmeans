I'm home and I had a great time. I'll give a more complete update later after my first day of full time work and a good night's sleep. I'm also sort of working on a top 40 most listened to songs of 2007 post. First here's something I wrote while I was in Montana. I'll post the second in my next post.<br><br>"Unsustainable Earth"<br>I was never brilliant, only distracted.<br>Ever present in an ill-defined elsewhere.<br>But I was born into a decomposing country.<br>And if this Eden is decaying into wasteland<br>I must ask myself: What was the time of death?<br>And is it too late for the surgeon's blade or the<br>pastor's cross to return life to a forsaken land?<br><br>I have no certainties about our salvation,<br>or our chances of salvation. Perhaps the end<br>will come like a burst of fire from the furnace.<br>Perhaps we will be swallowed as though in a swell<br>of the ocean. Perhaps there will be opportunity for<br>escape, to foreign lands or a more profitable future.<br>But avoiding the dystopian concerns too few. And the earnest<br>simplicity of obliviousness will lead untold numbers to oblivion.<br><br>There are good stories to be told here though<br>this may not have been an era of the brave and the<br>decent. I do not contend that we should not be reproached.<br>Still, an ending befitting our gluttony is to be resisted.
