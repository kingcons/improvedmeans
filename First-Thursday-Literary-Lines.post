Starting it off with one of my favorites:<br><br>Annalenna by Czeslaw Milosz<br><br>"It happened that sometimes I kissed in mirrors the reflection of my face; since the hands, face and tears of Annalena had caressed it, my face seemed suffused to me divinely beautiful and as if suffused with heavenly sweetness." - Oscar Milosz, <em>L'Amoreuse Initiation</em><br><br>I liked your velvet yoni, Annalena, long voyages in the delta of your legs.<br>A striving upstream toward your beating heart through more and more savage currents saturated with the light of hops and bindweed.<br>And our vehemence and triumphant laughter and our hasty dressing in the middle of the night to walk on the stone stairs of the upper city.<br>Our breath held by amazement and silence, porosity of worn-out stones and the great door of the cathedral.<br>Over the gate of the rectory fragments of brick among weeds, in darkness the touch of a rough buttressed wall.<br>And later our looking from the bridge down to the orchard, when under the moon every tree is separate on its kneeler, and from the secret interior of dimmed poplars the echo carries the sound of a water turbine.<br>To whom do we tell what happened on the earth, for whom do we place everywhere huge mirrors in the hope that they will be filled up and will stay so?<br>Always in doubt whether it was we who were there, you and I, Annalena, or just anonymous lovers on the enameled tables of a fairyland.
