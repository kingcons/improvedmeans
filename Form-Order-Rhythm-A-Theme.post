"To find my home in one sentence, concise, as if hammered in metal. Not to enchant anybody. Not to earn a lasting name in posterity. An unnamed need for order, for rhythm, for form, which three words are opposed to chaos and nothingness." - Czeslaw Milosz, Unattainable Earth, Pg. 141 (the last page)<br><br>"Since my youth I have tried to capture in words a reality such as I contemplated walking the streets of a human city and I have never succeeded; that is why each of my poems seems to me the token of an unaccomplished oeuvre. I learned early that language does not adhere to what we really are, that we move in a big make-believe which is maintained by books and pages of newsprint. And every one of my efforts to say something real ended the same way, by my being driven back to the enclosure of from, as if I were a sheep straying from the flock." - Czeslaw Milosz, Unattainable Earth, Pg. 32<br><br>"I have always aspired to a more spacious form<br>that would be free form the claims of poetry or prose<br>and would let us understand each other without exposing<br>the author or reader to sublime agonies.<br><br>In the very essence of poetry there is something indecent:<br>a thing is brought forth which we didn't know we had in us,<br>so we blink our eyes, as if a tiger had sprung out<br>and stood in the light, lashing his tail.<br><br>That's why poetry is rightly said to be dictated by a daimonion,<br>though it's an exaggeration to maintain that he must be an angel.<br>It's hard to guess where that pride of poets comes from,<br>when so often they're put to shame by the disclosure of their frailty.<br><br>What reasonable man would like to be a city of demons,<br>who behave as if they were at home, speak in many tongues,<br>and who, not satisfied with stealing his lips or hand,<br>work at changing his destiny for their convenience?<br><br>It's true that what is morbid is highly valued today,<br>and so you may think I am only joking<br>or that I've devised just one more means<br>of praising Art with the help of irony.<br><br>There was a time when only wise books were read,<br>helping us to bear our pain and misery.<br>This, after all, is not quite the same<br>as leafing through a thousand works fresh from psychiatric clinics.<br><br>And yet the world is different from what it seems to be<br>and we are other than how we see ourselves in our ravings<br>People therefore preserve silent integrity,<br>thus earning the respect of their relatives and neighbors.<br><br>The purpose of poetry is to remind us<br>how difficulty it is to remain just one person,<br>for our house is open, there are no keys in the doors,<br>and invisible guests come in and out at will.<br><br>What I'm saying here is no, I agree, poetry,<br>as poems should be written rarely and reluctantly,<br>under unbearable duress and only with the hope<br>that good spirits, not evil ones, choose us for their instrument." - Czeslaw Milosz, Ars Poetica, New and Collected Poems Pg. 240
