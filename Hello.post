Hi.<br>Without meaning to be a burden, encouragement would be a good thing for me right now. If you have any lying around and are interested, feel free to pass it my way.<br><br>I have in mind a future,<br>Perhaps in Chicago, then Montana,<br>Or maybe the white sands of the<br>beaches of my youth.<br>But the desire for home is an illusion,<br>Found in people not in places,<br>The trinkets I call thoughts are<br>only treasure if they're shared.<br>How can I swear myself<br>to safely guard your things,<br>and always maintain interest<br>in the head from which thought springs?<br>For my love is the attent<br>of the brook that babbles beyond<br>your lips. But in a world<br>ever warming, how can I promise<br>the well won't run dry?<br>Am I a dam holding<br>water which once broken<br>sends old currents back<br>to sea? That water<br>needed to return to<br>that amorphous oblivion.<br>It's vitality left<br>long ago.
