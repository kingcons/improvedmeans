I sort of forgot that schoolwork all bunches together for a nice crunch towards the end of the semester. Consequently, I'm juggling a fair bit at the moment. Not least because I'm also sorting out Financial Aid and Housing for the next year. On the bright side, I've got some fun projects in the works and I'm not <i>too</i> worried about my classes. I can say I'll be very glad to be done with the semester, even though my summer classes start May 18th. Thankfully, they all are in the afternoon Monday through Thursday.<br><br>Here are a few other things that have been going on:<br><br>President Obama gave the Queen of England an iPod loaded with 40 Showtunes. <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/04/first-sale-president-obama-and-queen-england">And we don't know if that's legal</a>. Think our Intellectual Property laws are messed up yet?<br><br>Apparently there's a <a href="http://www.concretedisciples.com/skateparksdb/skateparks_display.php?id=3363">pretty nice concrete skatepark near me</a>. With any luck Burke and I will be regulars over the summer while he's here. :)<br><br><a href="http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/updates/list">Unladen Swallow seems to be moving along nicely</a>. I jumped in to check on their progress. Speaking of Python, Mark Pilgrim is working on <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/table-of-contents.html">Dive Into Python 3</a> and it's online. There are also a few fun articles <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/109/pramode.html">on</a> <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-prog.html">Functional</a> <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-prog2.html">Programming</a> <a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000392.html">in</a> <a href="http://ivan.truemesh.com/archives/000411.html">Python</a>. Oh, and <a href="http://paddy3118.blogspot.com/2009/04/abuse-of-pythons-in-built-data.html">Named Tuples kind of rock</a>. You'll need Python 2.6 to use them though.<br><br><a href="http://bugs.archlinux.org/roadmap/proj6">Arch Linux is planning an April release</a> and they've got a fair amount slated to get done. I'm rather excited about it.<br><br>Some Last.fm devs implemented a <a href="http://github.com/erikfrey/bashreduce/tree/master">MapReduce framework in Bash</a> <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2009/04/06/mapreduce-bash-script">over the weekend</a>. I think it's awesome.<br><br>John Cowan has an endearing list of <a href="http://ccil.org/~cowan/essential.html">Essentialist Explanations</a> about languages that's fun to peruse.<br><br>Last but not least, I've been on a real John Mayer streak lately but here are two other songs that I've really enjoyed. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Folk+Implosion/_/E.Z.+L.A.">E.Z. L.A. by The Folk Implosion</a> is simply awesome. That whole album is, so get that. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Aesop+Rock/None+Shall+Pass/No+City">No City by Aesop Rock</a> is also quite excellent. I still prefer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Days">Labor Days</a> though. In other news, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer#Solo_discography">Mayer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillaz#Third_album">the Gorillaz</a> have albums slated to come out in the near future. You're thrilled, right?<br><br>
