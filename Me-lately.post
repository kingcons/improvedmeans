It's been pretty hard to maintain a positive spirit and spin on things lately. Times are hard economically, my financial margins are narrow to non-existent and new jobs are hard to find. I've also been trying to contact some people at <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">Northeastern </a>to look into going to school there (mostly because it's so hard to find the time\energy for self-study at present)  but the trail dead-ended. I've been unable to reach <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/">Olin Shivers</a> (who seems pretty <a href="http://www.scsh.net/docu/html/man.html">awesome</a> [best acknowledgments ever], <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/advisor-stmt-original.txt">incidentally</a>) so that's all inconclusive. Really, I'm looking to see how much work it would be to get accepted. I'm fairly enamored with their program <em>and </em>faculty and for one reason or another Boston sounds lovely.<br><br>I'm still hacking at <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?cat=4">SICP</a> when I have the energy/time but it's been really hard lately. I believe that I'm on the right path because knowing more about programming is something I have wanted for a long time but it's hard to stay the course or to stay emotionally charged up about the course. Part of that is because, as the <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=908">Emerging</a> <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=871">Philosophy</a> posts suggest, the problems I'm <em>really interested</em> in solving are not <em>Computer Science</em> problems. They're social problems. The oft-heard first project suggestion for hackers to "scratch an itch" or "fill a need" falls flat for me. The computer does everything I want it to do. I'm not looking for it to do more.<br><br>I am making progress with SICP, I'm just behind schedule. I'm hung up on the last 4 problems (2.13-2.16) in Chapter 2.1 but I <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/code">recently started plowing ahead</a> on Chapter 2.2 to get some momentum again and am about a third of the way through it. If anyone has advice or feels like working through them with me feel free to contact me via blog, IM, e-mail, etc.
