I was in Borders the other day and strolled through the poetry section. Surprisingly, there was a Milosz volume that my copy of his Collected Poems didn't contain. I also realized how much I'd like to read Bukowski and Neruda. I'm still working my way through the mountains of Milosz' catalog but diversity is a very important thing and when it comes to poetry I've just sort of been sitting in one corner for a while. T.S. Eliot would certainly be a more distant jump than Neruda or Bukowski. Frost would also be a good distance for that matter. Whitman not as much. At any rate, I stumbled upon a Neruda work online today that seems so applicable to events of late that I feel oddly compelled to post it. It's titled Tonight I Can Write The Saddest Lines.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br><br>Write, for example,'The night is shattered<br>and the blue stars shiver in the distance.'<br><br>The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br><br>Through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br>I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.<br><br>She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too.<br>How could one not have loved her great still eyes.<br><br>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.<br><br>To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.<br>And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br><br>What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br>The night is shattered and she is not with me.<br><br>This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br>My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br>My sight searches for her as though to go to her.<br>My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br><br>The same night whitening the same trees.<br>We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.<br>My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.<br><br>Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.<br>Her void. Her bright body. Her infinite eyes.<br><br>I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br>Love is so short, forgetting is so long.<br><br>Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br>my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br><br>Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br>and these the last verses that I write for her.
