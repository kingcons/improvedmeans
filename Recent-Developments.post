I know I haven't posted in a while. A lot has been happening. I found out earlier today that my Dad has lung cancer. I didn't want to post anything until we were sure. It's stage 4 and has spread beyond the lungs. It is treatable and we're going to see what we can do. All of this is a bit surreal. These are strange times. Oddly though, everything is pretty well timed. Mom is taking some time off work. I'm actually taking a year off school, working full time, and will be living at home for a few months so I'll be able to help out. I'm doing fine so far. Maybe the news will hit hard later.<br><br>I can say this: I don't have any regrets about not knowing him or spending time with him. It's been 16 or so awesome years. Hopefully there will be many more but I wouldn't change a thing about what's come so far. And that's one thing I can be very, very happy about.
