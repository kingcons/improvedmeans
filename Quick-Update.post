I'm studying for a Discrete Mathematics test tomorrow. Aaah!! I'm learning Predicate Calculus in that class though so that's exciting. It's fun to finally be a bit more versed in all that. It also helps that I listened to <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4167170843018186532">Faith, Evolution, and Programming Languages</a> yesterday and feel like I have a better understanding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">Type Systems Theory</a> thanks to that.<br><br>Other stuff: Thinking too much, as usual. Mostly about computers but also had good discussions with Teresa and Bria about the notion of progress and whether or not we are in a state of decline. More on that soon hopefully. I need to get some of those thoughts down after the discussions have fleshed out a bit more. Anyone else have thoughts to contribute or want in on the discussion?<br><br>I really want to write something about why Computer Science as a field is provocative and unique to me. I've also sort of started my nerd/programming pdf/ebookshelf. Presently on it are the following:<br>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelman and Sussman<br>The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 1-3 by Donald Knuth<br>Concrete Mathematics by Donald Knuth<br>Code Complete, 2e by Steve McConnell<br>The Tex Book by Donald Knuth<br>Programming Erlang by Joe Armstrong<br>The Best Software Writing (selected) by Joel Spolsky<br>Introduction To Algorithms, 2e by MIT Staff<br>Learning Perl, 4e by Phoenix and Schwartz<br>Linear Algebra and It's Applications, 3e by Gilbert Strang<br>The Practice of Programming by Kernighan and Pike<br>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning With Python by Downey, Elkner, and Meyers<br><br>I also have some physical copies of other books and should probably come up with a comprehensive syllabus (similar to the one I did for <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=245" title="Open Source Syllabus">open source a while back</a> and my <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=225" title="Hypothetical Bookshelf">book wish list</a> just before summer) for CS books in the near future.<br><br>This means I'm now studying two languages for school and two in my spare time. Java and C for school and Erlang and Scheme for fun. It makes me feel a little crazy because I don't know that anyone else actually does this. If there was someone else at SPSU that was studying Erlang that would literally surprise the hell out of me and I don't know how to feel about that. *shrug*<br><br>Also, I'm looking forward to possibly switching from Ubuntu to Fedora when Test2 drops on Thursday and I'm thinking of trying FreeBSD and Nexenta or OpenSolaris in the future. More on stuff like that and hardware nonsense later.<br><br>Finally, a few songs I've been enjoying:<br>Incubus - Talk Shows on Mute<br>The Stills - Yesterday Never Tomorrows<br>Guster - I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today<br>Zero 7 - Out of Town<br>Incubus - Agoraphobia
