My Neruda hasn't come in the mail yet so you all are stuck with another week of Milosz. This week's poem is titled Nonadaptation.<br><br>I was not made to live anywhere except in paradise.<br>Such, simply, was my genetic inadaptation.<br>Here on earth every prick of a rose-thorn changed into a wound,.<br>Whenever the sun hid behind a cloud, I grieved.<br>I pretended to work like others from morning to evening,<br>but I was absent, dedicated to invisible countries.<br>For solace I escaped to city parks, there to observe<br>and faithfully describe flowers and trees, but they changed,<br>under my hand, into the gardens of Paradise.<br>I have not loved a woman with my five senses.<br>I only wanted from her my sister, from before the banishment.<br>And I respected religion, for on this earth of pain<br>it was a funereal and a propitiatory song.
