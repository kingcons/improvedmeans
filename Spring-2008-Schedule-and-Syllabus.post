<p>So, I've finally gotten everything nailed down. I know what courses I'm taking, what resources I'm using, and what my schedule is.</p><br><p>I've decided to break my studies into 2 semesters each of which is comprised of two courses and lasts 20 weeks. The first semester started this Monday (1/14) and ends Friday (5/30). I then take the month of June off. The second semester will start Monday (7/7) and end (11/21). Having June and December off will both motivate me to push through and also allow room for slight changes in schedule.</p><br><p>I'll study SICP and Discrete Math with Applications by Rosen this semester. I've already started in on the SICP. Obviously I'm a little behind on the math. At the end of each week I'm planning to post a summary of exercises and notes at least for the programming courses. I don't know what I'll do on the Math course. I also haven't quite settled on whose problem sets to do. Ah, well.</p><br><p>Next semester it's HTDP and CTM. I'm a little freaked out looking at all this but if I try I'm bound to learn something. Wish me luck.</p><br><p>And here's the week by week breakdown of the first 4 weeks for each course:</p><br><p>discrete math: resources include lectures, problem sets, and course notes<br /><br>dma - 787 pages / 20 weeks = 39.35(40) pgs/week<br /><br>1 is lecture 11-01-00 and pgs.1-44 (through section 1.3)<br /><br>2 is lecture 11-02-00 and pgs.44-80 (through definition 4)<br /><br>3 is lecture 11-03-00 and pgs.80-119 (through chapter 1)<br /><br>4 is lecture 11-06-00 and pgs.119-161 (through theorem 7)</p><br><p>sicp: resources include lectures, online book, course notes, problem sets, and eli bendersky's site<br /><br>sicp - 610 pages / 20 weeks = 30.5(31) pgs/week<br /><br>1 is lecture 1-a and pgs.1-31 (through section 1.1)<br /><br>2 is lecture 1-b and pgs.31-62 (through section 1.3.1)<br /><br>3 is lecture 2-a and pgs.63-97 (through section 2.1)<br /><br>4 is lecture 2-b and pgs.97-126 (through section 2.2.3)</p><br><p>As far as my schedule goes, the plan is to work from 7am-3pm Monday through Friday, go to the gym after work on MWF, and veg on the weekends where possible. The workweek will be dedicated to my "education" of course, beyond work and exercise.</p>
