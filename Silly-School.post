This post is likely to be a bit scattered. Partially because I need to get back to doing homework in a minute but also because my brain has been in a lot of places lately. So here's a linkpost with thoughts on IP Law, Linux and other stuff. I also have a bunch of Lisp links but I'll dump those separately later...after I get some homework done.<br><br>I <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/09/microsoft-teaches-best-buy-employees-how-to-troll-linux-users.ars">keep</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/09/linux-foundation-to-microsoft-stop-secretly-attacking-linux.ars">hearing</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/09/ballmer-makes-a-scene-over-employees-iphone.ars">about</a> stupid moves by Microsoft lately. It's very confusing because in many ways my opinion of them has improved over the last few years. Not that I'd ever want to use a Windows-based OS again. I'm just too happy in Linux land. My point though, is that the company clearly has an old culture of anti-competitive wonkiness and a newer culture that seems more focused on creating good products and less on market manipulation. Maybe it's all just weird management stuff though. Hopefully that will change sooner rather than later. On the other hand, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2009/08/sonys-ad-pokes-fun-at-self-internet.ars">Sony seems to be getting their console act together</a> between dropping prices and actually putting out effective advertising for perhaps the first time in history. I'm also quite pleased with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/google-liberates-data-makes-it-easier-to-leave-the-cloud.ars">Google taking a (more official) stance on Data Portability</a>. It's something I feel pretty strongly about though I won't speak more about it today.<br><br>My hatred of AT&amp;T seems to be perpetually growing. The FCC is trying to come up with a more formal definition of broadband and the carriers are, in my view, trying to make that definition demand as little of them as possible. Generally, I've gotten to a point where I hate telecoms. So, I have a message for them: Give me fiber, or whatever wireless connectivity you're pimping this week, and shut the hell up. In other news, IP Law is still completely ridiculous and I can't begin to summarize or explain that here. I can offer an example or two though. The first is a list of <a href="http://gapersblock.com/mechanics/2009/08/17/seven-crimes-to-consider-befor/">seven felonies with less severe penalties than music piracy</a>. It's meant to be humorous. It's sadly surreal. I'll actually let that be enough of an example for today and link to a discussion of <a href="http://journalismschool.wordpress.com/2009/07/24/what-would-fair-use-look-like-in-an-online-era/">what fair use might look like in the 21st century</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/goodbye-drm-hello-stealable-digital-personal-property.ars">a curious idea of making digital property "stealable"</a>. Last but not least, I'm at least glad that good <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/software-patents-theres-no-baby-in-this-bathwater.ars">arguments against software patents</a> are being made to the Supreme Court. Crossing my fingers on that one!<br><br>Peter Seibel's <a href="http://www.codersatwork.com/">Coders at Work</a> has finally come out. I was looking forward to the book for a good while and have been enjoying reading the interviews. LtU recently <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3613">posted about it</a> also. I've got 7 of 15 knocked out. I've been surprised that the two interviews I think I've enjoyed the most were with Simon Peyton-Jones and Brendan Eich. I was expecting the Lispers or Smalltalkers to be more to my liking. *shrug* I'll likely write a review or at least talk more about it when I'm finished.<br><br>I've been following a few pieces of software (as usual). It's nice to see the competitiveness in the browser market of late. The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxWeeklyNotes">Chrome Linux team was disbanded recently</a> and I take it that work is now part of mainline so hopefully there will be an official Chrome release for Linux "Real Soon Now". I should also note the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/09/webkit-adoption-shows-strong-momentum-for-webgl-3d-graphics.ars">emerging standard for 3D Graphics on the web</a>. Something good will come of this. Additionally, GHC 6.12 is <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;priority=high&amp;milestone=6.12.1&amp;order=priority">coming</a> <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;milestone=6.12.1">along</a> nicely. Lots of bugfixes the last few days. Looking forward to GHC 6.12.1 RC getting out there even though I won't be using it. Rock on, Haskellers. <a href="http://pitivi.org/wiki/0.13.3">Pitivi also made another  release</a>. Now if only Arch would get an updated <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/pitivi/">pitivi package</a>, I'd be a very happy man. Oh, and there hasn't really been any more news on the N900. I'm keeping my ear to the ground.<br><br>Finally, this is the month of Linux conferences between the <a href="http://atlantalinuxfest.org/">Atlanta Linux Conference</a> this weekend, the almighty <a href="http://keithp.com/blogs/Linux_Plumbers_2009/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a> next week and the <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2009">X Developers' Conference</a> after that. Speaking of X, <a href="http://anholt.livejournal.com/41522.html">anholt reports continuing progress on the Intel front</a> and I feel warm and fuzzy inside. All for now folks, later!
