I am. 2007 was more trouble than I was really looking for. I'm certain that 2008 is going to rock hard though.<br><br>Part of that is that I've been cleared to work at TVS full time starting in January. That's one thing off my mind. I'll have more details when I return from my trip to Montana on the 9th. I leave next Wednesday, if you're curious.<br><br>I've got a lot that I've been taking care of and still have to take care of before the trip. So sorry for being distant. And the blog silence. Things are picking up though. I also have a slew of interesting projects to drone on about in the New Year.<br><br>Before all that though, a Xmas Recap. Xmas was great.<br><br><img src="http://www.redlinernotes.com/images/happy_xmas07.jpg" title="Happy Xmas 07" alt="Happy Xmas 07" height="576" width="768" /><br><br>You had this much fun too, right? I'm finally moved back into my room. Most importantly, my digital life is all pimped out.<br><br><img src="http://www.redlinernotes.com/images/workbench.jpg" title="Workbench" alt="Workbench" height="576" width="768" /><br><br>See? I've been working on pulling so much power from one outlet that I kill the house. Unfortunately I've only succeeded in dimming the lights. Just kidding. Well, about the trying to part anyway.<br><br>Before I get any questions I should note that the iPod is Dad's. I haven't converted yet. Additionally, the old Nokia has been replaced. The setup is great. I can switch between the laptop, desktop/server, and PS3 on the LCD. Presently I keep the speakers tied to the PS3 at all times but I'll probably buy an adapter to share them across the devices. Eventually I'll get around to doing the same for the keyboard and mouse. Fear the cable nesting that will occur.<br><br><img src="http://www.redlinernotes.com/images/fear_it.jpg" title="Fear It" alt="Cable Mess and Electrical and Heating Disasters, Here I come!" height="576" width="768" /><br><br>Now, on to projects. Of course, I'm going to start programming first and foremost. I've decided I ought to progress in the following order: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, then Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming, and finally How to Design Programs. On the side I'll be working on Rosen's Discrete Math, Spivak's Calculus, and maybe Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra. If I manage to work through even half of that this year that would be pretty good stuff. So far I own the following programming texts.<br><br><img src="http://www.redlinernotes.com/images/first_books.jpg" title="CS Heavyweights Represent" alt="There should be a sign: SICP Coming Soon. Right next to the Sipser. Yep." height="576" width="768" /><br><br>SICP is in the mail along with Discrete Math. I'm planning on ordering Spivak's Calculus and Strang's Linear Algebra later on.<br><br>Besides programming though you've got to have some stuff up your sleeve and I certainly do. I'm going to set this PC up for recording work and get some guitar doodles down at some point, just for fun. I also am filming virtual footage for a skate video. It makes me the biggest nerd possible but I don't mind. I've got 1 minute and 40 seconds of decent footie so far and some friends working on parts. Beyond that I'm going to work on getting Linux up and going properly on the PS3 and getting the speakers and input devices shared between all my systems as mentioned (probably with a KVM). I also will look into getting my PS3 to behave as a legitimate media server. Finally, I'm looking at getting my website server moved to a VM and run off my desktop. I've got the VM up and we'll see about performance issues and other testing soon.<br><br>I'm collecting Course Materials for SICP at the moment and have to run to take care of some of today's other nonsense but I'll be back for more soon. Peace!
