Some of you may be experiencing problems posting. Apparently, various livejournals\livejournalers are unable to post entries beyond a certain length. I'm unclear on what that length is but I've found a way around the problem. Use this link to post your entries from a web proxy: "http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/http://www.livejournal.com/update.bml" and it will go through. Just enter the link, fill out your username and password but<em> don't login</em> and then type out your entry and hit submit. Done and done. Personally I think the problem is linked to your IP address but if it works who cares.
