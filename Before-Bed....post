At over 5 weeks, this may be a new record for time without posting to this blog. That's okay though. I've had more important things to do lately.<br>For now, I just wanted to post a song I've enjoyed today. It's by the band Hammock and titled Shipwrecked. Lyrics and song follow:<br><br><blockquote>On a cold night<br>We lay down<br>Under starlight<br>We breakdown<br>Spend our whole life<br>Seeking shelter<br>Til the last time,<br>Gone forever...	</blockquote><br><br><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/BACunS0riec&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/BACunS0riec&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>
