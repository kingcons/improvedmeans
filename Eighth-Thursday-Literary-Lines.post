More Milosz today. I don't know. I'd swear it's good for the soul. I also feel so...illiterate posting Milosz all the time. It's just good for me though. Anyway, I've always loved this one and it seems particularly relevant today. What do you guys think?<br><br>Temptation<br>Under a starry sky I was taking a walk,<br>On a ridge overlooking neon cities,<br>With my companion, the spirit of desolation,<br>Who was running around and sermonizing,<br>Saying that I was not necessary, for if not I, then someone else<br>Would be walking here, trying to understand his age.<br>Had I died long ago nothing would have changed.<br>The same stars, cities, and countries<br>Would have been seen with other eyes.<br>The world and it's labors would go on as they do.<br><br>For Christ's sake, get away from me.<br>You've tormented me enough, I said.<br>It's not up to me to judge the calling of men.<br>And my merits, if any, I won't know anyway.
