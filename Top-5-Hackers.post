I got sort of preoccupied this weekend with the question of who my Top 5 Hackers are. They're not necessarily supposed to be the world's best hackers. Rather, they're programmers who I respect both technically and individually. There are plenty of people doing great work on interesting things and that wasn't the primary motivation behind this list. I'm not going to go too deeply into my reasoning or try to order the list in any particular way. I'll just lay it on you. I'm sure it will change some over time.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Carmack">John Carmack</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Frankel">Justin Frankel</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070621112839/http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/">Luke Gorrie</a>
