Okay. I'm kind of going to cheat today. I was planning on moving on from Milosz after posting what are <em>probably</em> my three favorite poems of his and post an excerpt from Borges today. The problem is I haven't gotten around to reading the Borges. So, for now, Borges will have to wait until next week and then hopefully I'll have read it. For now, here is another Milosz poem i'm intensely fond of.<br><br>At Dawn<br>How enduring. How we need durability.<br>The sky before sunrise is soaked with light.<br>Rosy color tints buildings, bridges, and the Seine.<br>I was here when she, with whom I walk, wasn't born yet<br>And the cities on a distant plain stood intact<br>Before they rose in the air with the dust of sepulchral brick<br>And the people who lived there didn't know.<br>Only this moment at dawn is real to me.<br>The bygone lives are like my own past life, uncertain.<br>I cast a spell on the city asking it to last.
