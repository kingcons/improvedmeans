Looking out on murky skies<br>I want to sound the bell,<br>Shout til my throat's gone,<br>Raise a little hell.<br>But there's no answer to the call<br>That will echo back to me<br>Because only time will tell<br>So I just have to wait and see.<br>And I want to be subversive,<br>Yeah I want to go against the grain,<br>Strike a few nerves and maybe<br>Cause a little pain.<br>But I get the sense that all of<br>That would simply be in vain,<br>Like a character on camera<br>Trying to escape the frame.<br><br>And though I don't know<br>What in days to come<br>Will still remain,<br>I'm waiting for it like<br>The dry earth waits<br>To greet the rain.<br><br>For I don't stand in the road<br>Looking out upon the fork.<br>I stand in amber fields of grain<br>Writing a cartographer's report.<br>Rather than traversing a garden<br>Full of forking paths,<br>I'll travel through the weeds<br>And meet you in the aftermath.
