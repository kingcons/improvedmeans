Today was awesome but as much as I love Borges I'm going to post some tasty Milosz tonight. More Borges next week...I promise. Or at least a different poet. :-D<br><br>Gift<br>A day so happy.<br>Fog lifted early, I worked in the garden.<br>Hummingbirds were stopping over honeysuckle flowers.<br>There was no thing on earth I wanted to possess.<br>I knew no one worth my envying him.<br>Whatever evil I had suffered, I forgot.<br>To think that once I was the same man did not embarrass me.<br>In my body I felt no pain.<br>When straightening up, I saw the blue sea and sails.
