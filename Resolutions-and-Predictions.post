So this is a stupid New Years Post and maybe it's a little late. Are you supposed to post these on New Years Eve? I don't know. Anyway, here we go.<br><br>Resolutions:<br><br>- By May, I will be over half way done with HTDP.<br>- By May, I will have analyzed over 1000 songs for samples and make at least one composition from said samples.<br>- I will maintain a 3.5 GPA. Sure that's probably not rigorous or demanding but discipline before excellence.<br>- I will blog and exercise (gym, jogging, or skateboarding) at least once a week.<br><br>Predictions:<br><br>- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Solid State Drives will attain an across-the-board performance advantage with a reasonable size disadvantage by Q4 2009. (~256gb for $300 or ~$1.25/gb)</span> Edit: Okay, that was <em>really</em> stupid and not what I meant to express. Solid State Drives <em>already</em> have an across the board performance advantage with a (for some definitions of) reasonable size disadvantage if you get a good drive (Read: Intel or Samsung). I was really trying to comment on affordability of said quality drives. The Intels are sitting at $500/80gb right now and I don't know about the Samsungs. I'm predicting ~$300/256gb by the end of 2009. I'm leaving myself leeway by not stating whether or not I mean fiscal 2009.<br>- No console will have a strong lead by the end of 2009 and we'll have to call this generation Console War a draw.<br>- Linux and Mac will continue to infiltrate the consumer market but will not exceed 10% of worldwide market share.<br>- The MPAA will follow the RIAA's lead and stop their lawsuits to pursue alternative means of Intellectual Property Rights enforcement.<br>- IP Law and laws covering digital property and privacy will see increased scrutiny and public awareness. (Hey, I'm just hoping.)<br><br>What haven't I thought of that I should have?
