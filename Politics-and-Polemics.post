<p>Dear Livejournal Readers: I feel like there's some pretty good discussion of my last post going on at my primary blog, <a href="http://www./&#comments">drop in and comment if you like</a>.</p><br><p>I've bumped into <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InfectiousGreed/~3/253300971/crude_oil_at_70.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/economics/2007/12/17/Why-Oil-Prices-Will-Drop">suggestions</a> today that prices for crude oil will spiral back down in a short term period (under a year) for various reasons. I'm not sure whether to be distressed over this news or not. I worry that we may lose ourselves again to <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9153550196656656736">the path of least resistance</a>, rather than recognizing that non-renewable energy should be discouraged and there is much we stand to gain if we can kick the habit. More on that soon. Sleep tight, folks.</p>
