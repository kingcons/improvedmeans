“Fail hard.  Fail with motherfucking gusto.  Succeeding, like flying, is throwing yourself to the ground and missing.” — <a href="http://www.somethingsimilar.com/wordpress" target="_blank">Jeff Hodges</a>, stolen from <a href="http://perkypants.org/blog/2007/08/07/qotd-jeff-hodges/">Jeff Waugh's Blog</a><br><br>"Computers can compute, but that's not what people use them for, mostly. Mostly, computers store and retrieve information." - Tim Bray<br><br>"Most programs are not write-once. They are reworked and rewritten again and again in their lives. Bugs must be debugged. Changing requirements and the need for increased functionality mean the program itself may be modified on an ongoing basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and understand the original code; it is therefore more important by far for humans to be able to understand the program than it is for the computer." - Yukihiro Matsumoto
