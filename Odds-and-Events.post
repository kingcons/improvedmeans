Good morning. Plenty has happened since yesterday. Let's recap.<br><br>Nick Ali has written up some <a href="http://boredandblogging.com/?p=388">details about Atlanta Linux Fest</a> in his blog. It's this Saturday on Northside Pkwy from 11am-6pm, there's pizza for $5 and I'll have my laptop and my ArchLinux derivative in case you want to see it along with download links and (if I can get some blank CDs) hard copies. <strong><em>You should come!</em></strong> I'll make it fun. I promise. Don't you all wonder why I'm so crazy about this shit sometimes? You'll know.<br><br>I was wondering where I'd host the ISOs for my ArchLinux derivative. It looks like that problem is solved. I give you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badongo">Badongo</a>. They have a 700mb upload limit and files stay up until they're inactive for 90 days if you're a free member. That's pretty excellent. Hopefully, I'll put out releases every three months or so though they'll mostly be package updates in all likelihood. At some point in the future (circa me getting a new laptop) I plan to do an Arch64-based RedLinux build and get images for it online. Now if only I can get the RedLinux portion of my site up by Saturday...<br><br>In bad tech news, I may have to get a computer with <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> going just for iTunes U. I don't know if that content is DRM'd and I suspect I could strip it out anyway. I guess I'm still evaluating my options for <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=718">stealing an education</a>.<br><br>In neat tech news, I'm generally more excited than the stuff Amazon is doing with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/AWS-home-page-Money/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3435361">AWS</a> than the stuff Google is doing these days technically. Let it never be said that I don't think the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080916-ahoy-matey-google-tries-to-patent-floating-data-centers.html">Floating Data Center idea</a> is pretty kick ass though.<br><br>Final tech note, Wordpress optimization seems to be about two things. <a href="http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2007/04/15/why-my-wordpress-site-is-so-much-faster-than-yours/">Installing WP-Cache or something similar</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/files/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-mysql-recommendations.txt">database tuning</a>. I mean, really, it's about reducing the number of times that PHP calls or database accesses need to occur but I should learn more about databases. Later on that is, when I'm thinking about building real sites.<br><br>Note to <a href="http://www.benchwarmersgrill.com/clairmont.html">Benchwarmers Clairmont</a>: I know you have a 21 and over age limit set. I'm 22. My <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/images/she_is_hardcore.jpg">girlfriend</a> and my buddy Kris aren't. We won your trivia night last week and things were cool with us then. We showed up this week and someone ID'd the whole table and asked us to leave. Here's a hint: If we're not planning on ordering alcohol and just want to play trivia and eat food you're losing business by asking us to leave. It's not like we haven't been there dozens of times before. Just a thought.<br><br>I'm looking at various options for housing next year. Our lease expires in May and I'm not sure what I'll be up to or where I'll be working but I suspect I'll want to live in roughly the same area I'm in now. I don't know that I'd want to be in the same house. The rate is good, the location is good, the home itself is really pretty decent. That said, managing 5 people in a house is a little...bleh. Teresa and I are both fond of the idea of Post Oglethorpe as a lot of our friends are there and it's close to school for her. I'm not sure how I feel about <a href="http://www.everyaptmapped.com/apartments/atlanta,georgia,ga/post+oglethorpe.html">the prices</a> though. I'd certainly want 3 people in a 2 bedroom since there are cheaper options than Post Oglethorpe available. <a href="http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/08/18/daily31.html">Post Oglethorpe was sold</a> just this August though. Maybe new management will bring changes. Time will tell.
