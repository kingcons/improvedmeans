It's getting harder and harder to post. I'm done with summer classes. Two A's and a C, so Fall will have to be better. The C was in my easiest class funny enough. I've got 16 days of freedom left. Today was my birthday.<br><br>I felt compelled to post something...and I settled on poetry since I don't have my own words handy at the moment. I grabbed Neruda because I post too much Milosz and the page happened to fall open to this. It wasn't what I had in mind....but I might have to give up and just let it be.<br><br>The Son<br><br><br><blockquote>Ah son, do you know, do you know<br>where you come from?<br><br>From a lake with white<br>and hungry gulls.<br><br>Next to the water of winter<br>she and I raised<br>a red bonfire<br>wearing out our lips<br>from kissing each other's souls,<br>casting all into the fire,<br>burning our lives.<br><br>That's how you came into the world.<br><br>But she, to see me<br>and to see you, one day<br>crossed the seas<br>and I, to clasp<br>her tiny waist,<br>walked all the earth,<br>with wars and mountains,<br>with sands and thorns.<br><br>That's how you came into the world.<br><br>You come from so many places,<br>from the water and the earth,<br>from the fire and the snow,<br>from so far away you journey<br>toward the two of us,<br>from the terrible love<br>that has enchanted us,<br>that we want to know<br>what you're like, what you say to us,<br>because you know more<br>about the world we gave you.<br><br>Like a great storm<br>we shook<br>the tree of life<br>down to the hiddenmost<br>fibers of the roots<br>and you appear now<br>singing in the foliage,<br>in the highest branch<br>that with you we reach.</blockquote><br><br>PS: The more I read <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/">Stephen O'Grady</a> and <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/">Charles Stross</a> (and I've only read Accelerando and Halting State...and his blog over the last 3 months) the dumber I feel and the more I'm aware of how much I don't know but want to know.
