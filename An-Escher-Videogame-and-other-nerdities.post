<p>One of the games I'm most excited about coming out this year is called echochrome. It's coming out for Playstation 3 and the PSP. No US release date has been announced but it will land in Japan on March 19th. While I normally don't bother with writing about games, this one's special. It's one of the most novel concepts for a game I've seen in years. In short:  you rotate a scene featuring an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_object" title="Impossible Object (wikipedia)">Impossible Object</a> such that an automated walking man can navigate it. It's a perspective-based puzzle game. Here look:<br><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QfICeBtVv8U&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QfICeBtVv8U&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object><br><br>Also, everybody is writing about CS Education lately which is awesome considering I've been thinking about it so much. Just look at all this mess:<br /><br><a href="http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2008/01/21/what-good-is-a-cs-degree/">The Enfranchised Mind article</a> (which may be the best of the bunch) and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/666ji/comments/">associated reddit comments</a><br /><br><a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/01/no-disrespect.html">Raganwald' No Disrespect article</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/666lg/comments/">associated reddit comments</a><br /><br>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/post/PLNKUURHQRKBJYSU">Mark Guzdial's take</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/665c2/comments/">associated reddit comments</a><a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/665c2/comments/"></a></p><br><p>It may sound like a cop-out but I think Abelson and Sussman had this right all along. We're so hopelessly early in the existence of Computer Science as a discipline that we don't have a clue what it really is yet. And when you don't know what something is, it's pretty hard to know how to present it. Or steer it's course. That's all for now.</p><br><p>Finally, a paper got thrown on LTU about a <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2622">dependently typed version of Scheme</a>. Very intriguing.</p>
