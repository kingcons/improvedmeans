So, how about a personal update to go with that code madness? I have my last two finals in Discrete Math and CS 102 Tuesday. Then I get to pack and fill out change of address forms in preparation for Teresa and I moving to our new place Tuesday. Then I have about a week before May 18th when summer session starts to square away things with the old house\landlord (cleaning, etc) and relax a bit. I'm looking forward to my Data Structures course this summer as well as to the Sixteenth Haskell Community Activities Report and the release of Pixar's Up. I hope to go see Up with a ton of people when it releases. Also, <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/edwardrv/2009/03/24/pitivi-progress-summer-of-code-and-android/">Pitivi was supposed to finally drop the first release of their 0.13.x branch in April and that date has slipped a bit</a>. Hopefully they'll put out a release soon.<br><br>Last but certainly not least, Dad has moved into the dining room and is now getting around via a wheelchair. I don't get the impression that the cancer is beginning to win and he can walk a little but odds are good he'll never be back to full mobility. Pray for him if you can and if you're interested in tracking his progress Mom is keeping a journal <a href="http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/johnmglennjr/journal">here</a>.<br><br>Just because I need it, here's some Sigur Ros:<br><div align="center"><style type="text/css"> @import url(http://skreemr.com/styles/embed.css);</style><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><TR> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-topleft"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-topleft.gif"/></TD> <TD CLASS="sk-toprow">Sigur Ros - Svefn-G-Englar</TD> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-topright"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-topright.gif"/></TD></tr><TR VALIGN="MIDDLE"> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-lightleft3"/> <TD CLASS="sk-lightback3"> <embed class="SkreemRPlayer" wmode="transparent" style="height:24px;width:290px;" src="http://skreemr.com/audio/player.swf" quality="high" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="290" height="24" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" flashvars="playerID=1&bg=0xCDDFF3&leftbg=0x357DCE&lefticon=0xF2F2F2&rightbg=0xF06A51&rightbghover=0xAF2910&righticon=0xF2F2F2&righticonhover=0xFFFFFF&text=0x357DCE&slider=0x357DCE&track=0xFFFFFF&border=0xFFFFFF&loader=0xAF2910&soundFile=http://stopokaygo.typepad.com/web/files/sigur_ros_svefngenglar.mp3"></embed> <img style="padding:0;border:0;vertical-align:bottom" src="http://skreemr.com/images/skreemr_logo_small_name_only.png"/> </td> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-lightright3"/></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="16"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-bottomleft.gif"></TD><TD CLASS="sk-bottomrow">Found at <a href="http://skreemr.com/link.jsp?id=6559435354556A&source=embed">skreemr.com</a></TD><TD WIDTH="16"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-bottomright.gif"></TD></TR></table></div>
