This is a Czeslaw Milosz poem that should have found it's way here a long time ago. It's called <i>Preparation</i>.<br><br>Still one more year of preparation.<br>Tomorrow at the latest I’ll start working on a great book<br>In which my century will appear as it really was.<br>The sun will rise over the righteous and the wicked.<br>Springs and autumns will unerringly return.<br>In a wet thicket a thrush will build his nest lined with clay<br>And foxes will learn their foxy natures.<br><br>And that will be the subject, with addenda. Thus: armies<br>Running across frozen plains, shouting a curse<br>In a many-voiced chorus; the cannon of a tank<br>Growing immense at the corner of a street; the ride at dusk<br>Into a camp with watchtowers and barbed wire.<br><br>No, it won’t happen tomorrow. In five or ten years.<br>I still think too much about the mothers<br>And ask what is a man born of woman.<br>He curls himself up and protects his head<br>While he is kicked by heavy boots; on fire and running,<br>He burns with a bright flame; a bulldozer sweeps him into a clay pit.<br>Her child. Embracing a teddy bear. Conceived in ecstasy.<br><br>I haven’t learned yet to speak as I should, calmly.
