Summer: Week 2: Finished<br><strike>Music Library Reorganization</strike> (Begun)<br><strike>Further Arch Linux Configuration<br>Including unexpected crazy reinstall and Openbox experimentation<br>Unbelievable Amounts of Sonya Drama<br>Withdrawal from OU Fall Courses<br></strike>Still Didn't: Programming Chapter 2, GYM! Shame on me.<br>As mentioned: Arch hacking involved much more experimentation than expected, also more learning.<br><br><strong>I also haven't mentioned to anyone yet that I had a job interview Thursday and I got the job and start tomorrow. I hope someone reads this and congratulates me cause it's a pretty bad ass job. I'll be helping with the Linux Systems Administration (working with everything to VMware ESX Servers to Apache\Tomcat machines). It's with a pretty reputable (from what I gather) sustainable architecture\design firm called TVS on the corner of Peachtree and 15th high up in the Promenade Building. I even get a parking pass...woot. Anyway, my hours are initially 7am-3pm T,W,Th. TVS also has offices in Dubai and Chicago and have worked lately on the new CDC campus.<br></strong><br>Summer: Week 3: Schedule<br>Tuesday<br>TVS<br>Sonya before\until 5<br>GYM<br>Reading\Hacking?*<br>Wednesday<br>TVS<br>Sonya<br>Reading\Hacking?*<br>Thursday<br>TVS<br>Sonya<br>GYM<br>It's my friday night party out probably.<br>Friday<br>Chill.<br>Blog.<br><br>*= Summer Reading has begun. I've gotten a number of the books on former lists or syllabi I've made. So far the summer reading list is as follows: Just for Fun by Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, Emergence by Steven Johnson, Sync by Steven Strogatz, The Wealth of Networks by Yochai Benkler (YES!YES!YES!), Infotopia by Cass Sunstein (also great), Worldchanging by Alex Steffen, Code by Lawrence Lessig, Introduction to Computing Systems by Patt and Patel, and The C Programming Language by Kernighan and Pike.<br><br>News for 5/28/07:<br>First off, <a href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/05/24/15994.aspx">Dell finally made their big announcement</a> this past Thursday. We've known it was coming since "<a href="http://redline6561.livejournal.com/2007/05/01/">the big day</a>" which I kindly added some insightful commentary to in that link. I promise I'll actually try to say something useful about this finally in the next day or two. Also, I might just delve into a lot of the mac\linux thoughts I've been having lately.<br>Compiz and Compcomm Gits have grown somewhat quiet...and a <a href="http://www.ubaight.com/pipermail/compcomm/2007-May/000741.html">poll went up on a name for Compcomm</a> just today. Packages are soon to follow.<br>NJ Patel has done a lot of work on the <a href="http://avant-window-navigator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ChangeLog">Avant-Window-Navigator codebase</a> and dropped a few updates.<br>And Oliver McFadden, that champion of men, is back in the Mesa git tearing up the R300 code. <a href="http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=mesa/mesa.git;a=shortlog">My hero</a>.<br>Kerneltrap posted some <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/8261">interesting commentary on crash dumps</a>.<br><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/view/xclaesse/2007/05/25/0">Empathy 0.5 was announced</a>. There are no packages yet but I'm definitely keeping my eye on this.<br><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2007/05/25/0">The GNOME roadmap was also released</a>. <a href="http://www.ssnsase.ac.in/hipaac2007/selpaper.html">And people are still doing work on semantic filesystems</a>, which makes me happy. But I also say just port ZFS already. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html">Apple's doing it</a>. They want a free ride.<br>Novell is sorry for their patent blunders and idiotic agreements with Microsoft. <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-23-1.html">Really</a>.<br>A <a href="http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2007/05/why_the_free_so.html">very interesting commentary</a> slipped through the cracks on me.<br>Someone has brought up one of those <a href="http://beuno.com.ar/archives/23">good ol' ideas</a> that seem to be ever kicking around under the surface.<br><a href="http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?src=rss&amp;id=1540">Sun says screw Microsoft's patent threats</a>, if nothing else, we've got your back (to Ubuntu, Red Hat, et al).<br>It sounds dumb <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Nanotech/18771/">but nanoglue</a>. Nano-scale manufacturing needs something.<br><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18784/">Hydrogen fuel from starch</a>. That's one way to get abundant energy. Maybe.<br>Some good work on <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070527101905.htm">embedded electronics in textiles</a>. Here comes fashion.
