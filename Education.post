I've received and/or stumbled over a lot of great education links over the past 6-9 months. Most of them come from <a href="http://williamhalliburton.com/">William Halliburton</a> but a few are from other places.<br><br>Let's start out with the famous <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">Ted Talk by Sir Ken Robinson</a> and <a href="http://www.spinninglobe.net/againstschool.htm">John Taylor Gatto's Against School</a>.<br>Then it's time for a good dose of <a href="http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-illic.htm">Ivan Illich</a>, say his work <a href="http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Deschooling/intro.html">Deschooling Society</a>. And generally, anything from the site <a href="http://infed.org/">infed.org</a>.<br>Finally, some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed ">Pedagogy of the Opressed</a> should be <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070920153809/http://marxists.anu.edu.au/subject/education/freire/pedagogy/index.htm ">absorbed</a>. Mmmm. Good thought food right?<br><br>Now what?<br>If you've actually read all this and you're a computer nerd it's worth thinking about how to use computers and actually <em>implement this damn stuff</em>.<br>Start with John Wiley's <a href="http://opencontent.org/docs/ososs.pdf">Online Self-Organizing Social Systems</a> paper. <a href="http://opencontent.org/">John Wiley's site</a> is full of good resources and <a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/">his blog</a> and <a href="http://opencontent.org/docs/">other papers</a> are good as well. It might be worth reading a bit about <a href="http://instructor.aviation.ca/content/view/140/75/">Connectivism</a> here too.<br><br>I'm not as much of a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object_metadata">Learning Object Metadata</a> as a solution but it's a prominent idea so you're best off at least being <a href="http://ltsc.ieee.org/wg12/">familiar with it</a>. Finally, it's good to be familiar with what others have done that's already out there so have a look at the <a href="http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/ ">Open University</a>, <a href="http://schoolofeverything.com/">School of Everything</a> and <a href="http://www.learnhub.com/">Learnhub</a>. Let me know your thoughts.
