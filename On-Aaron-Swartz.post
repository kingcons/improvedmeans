I can't remember a death feeling this much like a personal attack. The best way I can describe the *feeling* is this: One of my heroes was slaughtered by my government for defending my beliefs. Of course, the sad reality is that Aaron took his own life, persecuted or not. As a disclaimer, I never knew him over the net or otherwise but I always looked up to him as one of our brightest lights. To everyone else who is grieving, I love you. Hold together and we will create the better world that Aaron was so clearly fighting for.

EDIT: Initially, I had intended this post to explain in greater detail _why_ Aaron's death has affected me as much as it has. I couldn't quite find the words but John Atkinson has done a beautiful job capturing my feelings [on his blog](http://discountgeni.us/2013/01/13/why-am-i-so-upset-about-aaron-swartzs-suicide/). Please read it.
