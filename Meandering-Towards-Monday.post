It's been a nice, leisurely weekend thus far. I've been meaning to post more and to post some things that are a bit less technical but I've been bad about making the time of late. This is a smattering of things that have been backed up in my head.<br><br>I realized recently that there's a Milosz poem I never threw up here that I really wished I had. It's titled <em>Diary of a Naturalist</em> and taken out of his work <em>From The Rising of The Sun</em>.<br><br>My generation was lost. Cities too. And nations.<br>But all this a little later. Meanwhile, in the window, a swallow<br>Performs its rite of the second. That boy, does he already suspect<br>That beauty is always elsewhere and always delusive?<br>Now he sees his homeland. At the time of the second mowing.<br>Roads winding uphill and down. Pine groves. Lakes.<br>An overcast sky with one slanting ray.<br>And everywhere men with scythes, in shirts of unbleached linen<br>And the dark-blue trousers that were common in the province.<br>He sees what I see even now. Oh but he was clever,<br>Attentive, as if things were instantly changed by memory.<br>Riding in a cart, he looked back to retain as much as possible.<br>Which means he knew what was needed for some ultimate moment<br>When he would compose from fragments a world perfect at last.<br><br>Isn't that nice? Here's one I wrote that just sort of flew out this afternoon:<br>The world is not chaos or justice,<br>Mere good and bad happening all round.<br>Swept under the rug in our wake,<br>Dust returning to dust, in clumps at that.<br>We do not like to go quietly, or alone.<br>But what of the unquantifiable interim?<br>Ah, qualified not quantified: Rich, peerless,<br>Are there stories greater than our own?<br>Certainly not with more twists, turns, surprises.<br>Still, here I am, trying to understand how:<br>I have become trapped like a fly in amber.<br>Like those who have come before me, now<br>Teachers, who sought after explications for the<br>Milieu of an era, the abstract of an age.<br><br>I'm not sure what I think but I may be warming up to it. Now that that's out of the way.<br><br>Top 5 Books I couldn't live without:<br>Unattainable Earth by Czeslaw Milosz<br>Hackers &amp; Painters by Paul Graham<br>Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton<br>The Success of Open Source by Steven Weber<br>The Future of Ideas by Lawrence Lessig<br><br>Honorable Mentions:<br>Selected Essays by Jerzy Kosinski<br>The Blue Octavo Notebooks by Franz Kafka<br>The Trial by Frans Kafka<br>Tender is the Night OR The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald<br>The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera<br><br>Of late, I've also really been enjoying reading Founders at Work by Jessica Livingston. If you're considering ever starting your own company or if you'd just be edified by reading about people succeeding outside the system/convention and innovating I'd highly recommend picking it up. There's also a book called Coders at Work in progress at the same publisher by a different author. That book is composed of interviews with some of the world's premiere programmers and it may find it's way onto the can't live without list. At least, I expect it will.<br><br>As my last point today, I'd like to congratulate Electronic Arts. They have successfully made the first good skateboarding video game in years. This is a huge thing for me because I love skateboarding games because I'm a big skate nerd and it's taken way too long for someone to best Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. Honestly, what happened to you Neversoft? Anyway, I highly endorse EA Blackbox's new game skate. It's amazz-z-zing. I might need to end up getting one more game console after all. Alright, more later folks.
