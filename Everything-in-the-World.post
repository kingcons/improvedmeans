I can't believe it's already October. It seems like only yesterday that I decided to take a break from school. For that matter, it seems like only yesterday that I became unemployed...but this was week 3 and a pleasant week it was. I'm continuing to try and buckle down and be more productive in various ways in spite of the fact that I don't <em>really</em> need money for another month and a half or so. So, what's been going on of late?<br><br>The Employment World: My interview with <a href="http://www.kslaw.com/">King and Spalding</a> went pretty well. It was very straightforward and none of the technical questions were remotely difficult. By the sound of it, it will also pay more than my last job. That's a good and bad thing. It's good because a decent wage would be nice and my last job wasn't one in my opinion. It's bad because it may be more remedial than my last job. It's a little retroactively upsetting to realize that I'd be paid more here for what sounds like substantially less difficult technical work. We'll see. I also know it'll take a week or two before they let me know whether or not I'm on the list for an in-person interview. Thanks to everyone who asked about it and or wished me well. Devon and Don, I'm looking at ya'll.<br><br>The Education World: My friend Will keeps sending me awesome links to research, papers, sites and articles. I also had a fascinating conversation on schools and education with Oglethorpian Chris Latshaw and was reminded why I love Oglethorpe in the process. Conversations like those made the school worth it. I should get around to writing more about all that next week. Also, (to Will) I'm half-way through <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> and hung up on an element of the chat program. I'm being a sissy about e-mailing you questions. I'll write this one off soon, I promise but I'm just trying to wrap a sane Chat UI around the Spread library. I'll send more details soon. Finally, I've downloaded about 100GB of video lectures about coding and math this week. I spent an afternoon queuing them up and left it running a few days. Remember me <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Open-Content-Mass-Storage.html">complaining about everything being in Real Format</a>? Well, I still won in the end. It wrapped up this afternoon. My apologies to the Internet Archive's <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/arsdigita">Ars Digita mirror</a>. They must feel violated.<br><br>The Linux World: The <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2008/10/10/linux-kernel-2-6-27-officially-released">Linux Kernel version 2.6.27 was released Friday</a>. Development will start on 2.6.28 now. I'm excited about 2.6.28 because I'm hoping <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Linux_Weather_Forecast/filesystems#Btrfs">btrfs</a> gets pushed into mainline. That could take a little while but it's still fun. Also, this is the first time that release season has come around and I'm really not interested in Ubuntu or Fedora. <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a>/<a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/RedLinux-released.html">RedLinux</a> has me pretty satisfied.<br><br>The Code World: There are some <a href="http://www.tele-task.de/page42_mode1_series653.html">really cool lectures at the S3 conference</a>. I <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Less-fun-More-funk.html">posted about it before</a> because Dan Ingalls presented the Lively Kernel but at this point I'm also really interested in the STEPS project and Ian Piumarta's work. Partially because I'm <a href="http://lukego.livejournal.com/16036.html">really jealous of Luke Gorrie</a>, again. And I hope that OLPC XO's really do become more reflective and Lisp Machine like. Beyond that, I stumbled on two web framework tutorials lately, neither of which I have the time to work through really. Sad. One is in <a href="http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2008/10/factor-web-framework-example.html">Factor</a> and the other is in <a href="http://docs.plt-scheme.org/continue/index.html">PLT Scheme</a>. Sexy!!!<br><br>The Friends World: Don Gerz has written a number of things that caught my eye lately. Particularly a <a href="http://dongerz.livejournal.com/19419.html">piece about Kierkegaard</a>. Lex has also written some provocative <a href="http://flyingover.livejournal.com/538776.html">questions about Banksy</a>. I hope she'll post her paper when it's done. She's also looking to try Ubuntu in the near future. Go lex! <a href="http://krow684.livejournal.com/">Kris Osterhage</a> <em>simply hasn't been posting enough</em>. ;-)<br>Chris Blair <a href="http://wilkesborosquare.blogspot.com/2008/10/this-election-is-horrible.html">wants this election to be over</a>. I'm rather with him on that one.<br><br>That's most of it. I need to write up a cheatsheet for the emacs and slime commands I'm using and then 2 or 3 articles on the stuff about Common Lisp I've been learning. Maybe at the end of it all I'll go back and revise my positions from the <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Language-Adoption-and-Lisps.html">Language Adoption and Lisp</a> article. Other than that, I'm trying to get through Season 2 of 30 Rock before Season 3 kicks off at the end of this month and really enjoying the break from employment that I have. Now somebody hire me already! More soon, everyone.
