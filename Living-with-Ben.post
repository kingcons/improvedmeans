Living with Ben was pretty bad ass. We stayed up late arguing about stuff that only one of us really knew anything about (computers or philosophy), made crazy playlists, played smash bros, and generally had lots of fun. Dan was awesome too but he just hid in his room a lot and then popped out and surprised everybody with amazingness. You wouldn't know it from looking at the guy but he was totally the comic relief.<br><br>I mention this though because Ben and I might end up living together again sometime after May. I'm for it. And just so you all know, I'm really hoping to live within around Peachtree Industrial, near Oglethorpe. So, if you know good apartment complexes, guest houses, etc, Holla.<br><br>Anyway, we worked on this one playlist for like...two weeks or something? I don't know. We came up with a first version which was pretty bad ass by itself but it diverted from the direction I had in mind originally (it started off as my baby) after the Broken Social Scene track...or maybe the Ambulance LTD track. Long story short, I spent another few days to come up with this Version 2 which pretty much sticks to my original vision. Here it is for your thoughts and enjoyment:<br><br><br>1. The Faces - Ooh-ooh-la<br>2. Blind Melon - No Rain<br>3. Fastball - Out Of My Mind<br>4. The Five Stairsteps - O-o-h Child<br>5. Marvin Gaye - Where Are We Going<br>6. The Beatles - Come Together<br>7. Ambulance LTD - Young Urban<br>8. Broken Social Scene - Looks Just Like The Sun<br>9. Psapp - Tricycle<br>10. Massive Attack - Teardrop<br>11. Corinne Bailey Rae - Trouble Sleeping<br>12. Regina Spektor - On The Radio<br>13. Gnarls Barkley - St.Elsewhere<br>14. Jamie Lidell - What's The Use<br>15. Elliot Smith - Son of Sam<br>16. Ambulance LTD. - Arbuckles Swan Song<br>17. Cat Power - Willie
