Well, it's been a long spell since <a href="http://blog.viridian-project.de/2010/01/24/paktahn-0-8-3-released/">the last paktahn release</a>. There are reasons for it but I'm just glad we got the release out.<br><br>The "big feature" of the release is AUR updates which I am happy to have implemented. I wouldn't have been able to get it done if versioning support hadn't been kicked off by Wei Hu (wh5a) <a href="http://github.com/wh5a/paktahn/commit/a82b9dacfc0549d60067e367c8efdcc4021c8b7e">a while back</a> though. At any rate, AUR Updates are in as is support for the .tar.xz format which Arch has adopted for packages going forward.<br><br>Beyond that we have a new contributor to the project, <a href="http://github.com/bigjust">Justin Caratzas</a>, that I've enjoyed working with and hope to work with more in the future. Justin fixed <a href="http://github.com/skypher/paktahn/issues/closed#issue/22">a bug in how AUR packages were installed</a> regarding whether or not they were installed as dependencies.<br><br>I should have more time to hack on paktahn this semester than last semester so hopefully there won't be a commitÂ gap for 2 months like there was before. I'm already looking at features for 1.0 and my biggest priority is reworking the command-line option handling using <a href="http://github.com/astine/unix-options">astine's unix-options</a> and then extending paktahn to support pacman's -Syu, -Sy and -Su. Then I wouldn't ever need to call down to "regular old" pacman. Other than that it might be nice to get support for Paktahn on <a href="http://trac.clozure.com/ccl">CCL</a> or <a href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net/">ECL</a> and a test suite written. CCL support is complete save catching Ctrl+C and offering restarts as appropriate. There <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.openmcl.devel/5393">isn't exactly a clear path</a> to implementing said support...<br><br>Anyway, if you're a user and you find a bug or want a feature, head for <a href="http://github.com/skypher/paktahn/issues">the issues page</a> and let us know about it!
