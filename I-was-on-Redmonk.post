Somehow I made one of <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/03/24/links-for-2007-03-24/">Governor's link posts way back in March</a> and totally missed it. I have no idea how I missed that. What I'm really wondering though is how in the world he found me to begin with. James, are you reading this? Additionally, at least it looks like I'm reading the right things.<br><br>Also, I'm trying to get permission from Sweeney to blog about the things we've been discussing. I don't know if I mentioned to you guys that I received a very nice e-mail back from him that went into some good detail on his opinion. I'll keep you all posted. I know you can't wait! More later...
