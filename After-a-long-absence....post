It's been a long time since I've posted. I meant to take it easy on myself with blogging this year but not that easy. It has been a damn crazy year so far though. Thankfully, I've had a good time writing code and picking up an old hobby or two. I've been playing Magic the Gathering again (I know, I'm a nerd). The sun is out and my skateboarding is markedly less crappy than a few months ago. But I miss writing.<br><br>Today I'm posting a piece I started a few weeks ago. I'm still not quite pleased with it (it seems a bit over the top) but I probably never will be. I think I'll just call it "Words".<br><br>I remember having words and<br>never knowing whence they came.<br>I often stumbled into them, embarassing myself<br>before greater edifices to literature.<br>Though I had no hope of greatness, of poetry,<br>I miss that corpus into which I could pour:<br>childish thoughts and old desperation,<br>longings and abstract hopes for things<br>I even still cannot name.<br><br>Where did my words all run off to?<br>I used to fit into them so nicely.<br>A bit of my foot in this one, a leg in that one.<br>Even a nice place for my fingers to keep me<br>from grasping at everything, insatiable.<br>I wore them around proudly, pointing to each<br>in turn and saying, "Look! Here. This is who I am."<br><br>But these days I am naked and scared to venture outdoors.<br>I still run into words sometimes.<br>A few in the sink with the dirty dishes,<br>others left in a coat pocket with a crumpled bill.<br>Yet it is only by accident we are in the same place.<br>My words are on fire and that's how I've been.<br><br>PS: You should all pay some attention to the new albums "Gorilla Manor" by the Local Natives and "Tourist History" by Two Door Cinema Club. They're helpful, also good for the spring season. Cheers.<br><br>PPS: Special thanks to Don Gerz and Max Kelley for accidentally providing motivational material to keep blogging.
