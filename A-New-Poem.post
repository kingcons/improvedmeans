I haven't posted poetry in almost a year. I've been trying to write a little more lately and managed something tonight. As always, it would be better to leave it on the disk, rewrite, rewrite...but here it is.<br><br><i>Natural Forces</i><br><br>How do birds die, I wonder?<br>Does it feel unnatural to them without<br>the flutter of wings? Death is not gentle.<br>No one dies gliding down on soft currents.<br>It will not take you in your home,<br>you shall be removed from it. Hence birds,<br>only sensing weight, levity forgotten.<br><br>I think of this too much and lose my stomach.<br>I should be capturing my youth enjoying<br>music, all our souls singing out,<br>streams of gorgeous women, glittering smiles<br>and brave eyes ready to dance and forget,<br>cauliflower with parmesan, the smell of magnolias,<br>the succulent crimson juice torn<br>from beneath the skin of a plum.<br><br>But I arrive home and recognize only weariness in myself.<br>I seek a long drink and some place to rest my head,<br>tired of these huge thoughts which so clearly will not fit.<br>And I remember days my heart ran with the wind,<br>crashed with the waves, set with the sun.<br>
