This is just going to be a quick post before I get back to work. Things rather suck lately. And when I say things, I mean summer school. I'm just not motivated about my work. I don't really feel like I'm learning and growing as much as I could be. I'm interested in doing what energizes me and spending time with the people I love, doing what I love. Unfortunately, I've got to make it to August before relaxation can become a priority. On the other hand, I have phenomenal support from most everyone in my life, I'm happy with most aspects of how my life is going and mom and I seem to be handling Dad's death pretty well.<br><br>So what have I been enjoying lately? Pixar's Up means a great deal to me and I've seen it 3 times now, <a href="http://nymag.com/movies/profiles/54318/">Armond White</a> <a href="http://the-following-preview.blogspot.com/2009/05/armond-white-and-pixars-up.html">be damned</a>. I've been skateboarding a lot more and I finally got around to checking out <a href="http://www.concretedisciples.com/skateparksdb/skateparks_display.php?id=3363">Brookrun Skatepark</a> with my good friend Burke, <a href="http://twitter.com/BurkeHRamsey/status/2266074724">see</a>? It's just 10 minutes away. Yes!<br><br>On the technical side, I've been playing more and more with lisp (I love it so) even though I can't stop reading the haskell reddit. Hell, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell/2009-June/021442.html">Haskell is even about to wind up on the iPhone</a>. I also have pulled down a bunch of <a href="http://xach.livejournal.com/221433.html">Erik Naggum posts</a> which I'd like to read and hopefully learn something from. Last but not least, I'm looking forward to getting a phone in the near future to replace my aging Nokia and I'm leaning towards an Android handset (the Samsung i7500/Galaxy) or a rumored Nokia running Maemo 5. Either way, it'll be August before I know for sure at which point I'll try to defend the reasoning behind my purchase.<br><br>There's plenty of other stuff I'd love to post but that's it for now. Hopefully, I'll have a chance to post more and dump some links out of the browser closer to the weekend. Back to schoolwork. :(<br><br><div align="center"><style type="text/css"> @import url(http://skreemr.com/styles/embed.css);</style><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><TR> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-topleft"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-topleft.gif"/></TD> <TD CLASS="sk-toprow">Chemical Brothers - Where do I begin</TD> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-topright"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-topright.gif"/></TD></tr><TR VALIGN="MIDDLE"> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-lightleft3"/> <TD CLASS="sk-lightback3"> <embed class="SkreemRPlayer" wmode="transparent" style="height:24px;width:290px;" src="http://skreemr.com/audio/player.swf" quality="high" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="290" height="24" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" flashvars="playerID=1&bg=0xCDDFF3&leftbg=0x357DCE&lefticon=0xF2F2F2&rightbg=0xF06A51&rightbghover=0xAF2910&righticon=0xF2F2F2&righticonhover=0xFFFFFF&text=0x357DCE&slider=0x357DCE&track=0xFFFFFF&border=0xFFFFFF&loader=0xAF2910&soundFile=http://overlandtrucks.com/system-f/where_do_i_begin.mp3"></embed> <img style="padding:0;border:0;vertical-align:bottom" src="http://skreemr.com/images/skreemr_logo_small_name_only.png"/> </td> <TD WIDTH="16" CLASS="sk-lightright3"/></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="16"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-bottomleft.gif"></TD><TD CLASS="sk-bottomrow">Found at <a href="http://skreemr.com/link.jsp?id=66524A57525F65&source=embed">skreemr.com</a></TD><TD WIDTH="16"><IMG style="padding:0;border:0;" SRC="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-bottomright.gif"></TD></TR></table></div>
