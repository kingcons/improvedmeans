and I find the resources to read. This SICP studying is harder than I ever could have imagined. I have done approximately nothing in my math, putting me about two weeks behind tomorrow. My focus has been entirely on SICP. SICP, I'm only a few days behind on thankfully. It's really hard stuff. And as somebody noted, charmingly, at this stage it practically is math. And proof by induction, recursive functions, golden ratios and Fibonacci sequences math. Not your grandpa's arithmetic.<br><br>Anyway, I've dug up some resources hitting snags here and there. It's what I do. So far, I've found a really great SICP Wiki (but it's half Russian), and a pack of people that have studied it from the Open Courseware over the past year.<br><br>That pack is as follows:<br><a href="http://www.kendyck.com/solutions-to-sicp/">Ken Dyck's Solutions</a><br><a href="http://blog.petersheats.com/sicp-exercises/">Peter Sheats Solutions</a><br><a href="http://nothinghappens.net/index.php?s=SICP">Chuck Hoffman's Blog</a><br><a href="http://www.michaelharrison.ws/weblog/?cat=8">Michael Harrison's Solutions and Commentary</a><br><a href="http://ozten.livejournal.com/">Ozten's Solutions and Commentary</a><br>and finally, <a href="http://lispy.wordpress.com/2007/09/22/mastering-higher-order-programming-techniques-with-sicp-chapter-1/">The Lispy Solutions and Commentary</a> which so wonderfully motivated and inspired me tonight. Particularly with regards to a remark on Section 1.1 "just lulling you into a false sense of security".<br><br>Of course, there is also the aforementioned <a href="http://histoma.com/sicp/FrontPage">SICP Wiki</a> and <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/category/programming/lisp/sicp/">Eli Bendersky's Blog</a>. Long story short, I really owe it to Lispy for encouraging me. Half way through section 1.2 I was bogged down. Roughly on exercise 1.13 which apparently gave a few other people trouble too. And I felt all alone.<br><br>Anyway, I'm going to try to push my schedule back a week and see if by next Friday I can be up to lambdas and through 80 pages of Discrete Math and then continue as planned. At the very least, I've known from day one that the one thing I want most to accomplish this year is wringing as much as I can out of SICP. So if it takes the whole year just to do that, schedules be damned, so be it.
