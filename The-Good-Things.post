This is a test of something a little different. This will be a personal post detailing some good things that happened to me yesterday. Ya know, because that perspective is good.<br><br>Good Things that happened to me today:<br>My algorithms test got pushed to next Wednesday. Two days is time for me to learn more.<br>I setup plans to see Where the Wild Things Are with Max (possibly others...) this weekend.<br>I got to listen to a lot of good music: Bill Evans Trio, Bibio, Four Tet, Memory Tapes, Deerhunter, Two Door Cinema Club, French Kicks...<br>I wrote a simple wrapper macro on with-interrupts for ECL&lt;-&gt;SBCL portability.<br>I just enjoyed seeing people: Alisa, Bansri, Christian, Elisha, Kelly, Trevis, Professor Snook, Professor Brown, pretty much everybody.<br>Don Gerz made a funny post on my wall.<br>I enjoyed reading some news on reddit and hackernews. I also enjoyed Chris Cole week at the berrics.<br>My financial aid finally came in. I need to check up on that Friday.<br>I got warned about a quiz on Friday. Always better to know in advance.<br>A bug I found in ECL got confirmed by Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll. Might not get fixed right away but hey, that's something.<br>I defeated some (but not all) of my Algorithms homework. It's progress.<br>I felt attractive.<br>Teresa felt like making a grocery run. There was Sorbet for dessert.<br>Teresa.
