I haven't posted, read or written much poetry in a while. I've been focused on other things and while I'm happy about how I've chosen to focus my energies I miss poetry. With that in mind, I stumbled across a Rilke poem this morning <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2008/06/americas-capability-for-change.html">thanks to Tim O'Reilly</a> and decided to reproduce it here.<br><br>Archaic Torso of Apollo<br>We have no idea what his fantastic head<br>was like, where the eyeballs were slowly swelling. But<br>his body now is glowing like a lamp<br>whose inner eyes, only turned down a little,<br><br>hold their flame, shine. If there weren't light, the curve<br>of the breast wouldn't blind you, and in the swerve<br>of the thighs a smile wouldn't keep on going<br>toward the place where the seeds are.<br><br>If there weren't light, this stone would look cut off<br>where it drops so clearly from the shoulders,<br>its skin wouldn't gleam like the fur of a wild animal,<br><br>and the body wouldn't send out light from every edge<br>as a star does...for there is no place at all<br>that isn't looking at you. You must change your life.
