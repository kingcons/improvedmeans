It seems I just can't help myself when it comes to this guy. Here's some of his work from <em>Second Spaces</em> which I believe is the last of his poems that were published.<br><br>From Part III, Treatise on Theology:<br>4. I Apologize<br>I apologize, most reverend theologians, for a tone not befitting the purple of your robes.<br>I thrash in the bed of my style, searching for a comfortable position, not too sanctimonious and not too mundane.<br>There must be a middle place between abstraction and childishness where one can talk seriously about serious things.<br>Catholic dogma is a few inches too high; we stand on our toes and for a moment it seems to us that we see.<br>Yet the mystery of the Holy Trinity, the mystery of Original Sin, the mystery of the Redemption are well armored against reason.<br>Which tries in vain to get straight the story of God before His creation of the world, and when the separation into good and evil occurred in His Kingdom.<br>What in all that can be grasped by little girls in white for First Communion!<br>If even gray-haired theologians concede that it is too much for them, close the book, and invoke the inadequacy of the human tongue.<br>But it will not do to prattle on about soft little Jesus in the hay of His manger.<br><br>And also this one, from Part III's Treatise on Theology as well:<br>15. Religion Comes<br>Religion comes from our pity for humans.<br>They are too weak to live without divine protection.<br>Too weak to listen to the screeching noise of the turning of infernal wheels.<br>Who among us would accept a universe in which there was not one voice<br>Of compassion, pity, understanding?<br>To be human is to be completely alien amid the galaxies.<br>Which is sufficient reason for erecting, together with others, the temples of an unimaginable mercy.<br><br>That one actually reminds me of <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=223">something I wrote once</a>...
