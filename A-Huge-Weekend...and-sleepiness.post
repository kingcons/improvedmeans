It's been a big weekend. I'm pretty exhausted and not entirely ready for the week to come but I'll have to get a good night's sleep and let that suffice as preparation. I'm still working on the weblocks/lisp stuff. Should have a blog article up by this Friday with any luck and there are plans for more in the series.<br><br>I enjoyed a friend's wedding in San Antonio the past two days. One thing I noticed today is that I never posted a Milosz poem that seemed appropriate to the weekend's events. I figured I would have by now. I'm quite fond of it so here it is, from Unattainable Earth, page 9:<br><br><em>After Paradise</em><br><blockquote>Don't run any more. Quiet. How softly it rains<br>On the roofs of the city. How perfect<br>All things are. Now, for the two of you<br>Waking up in a royal bed by a garret window.<br>For a man and a woman. For one plant divided<br>Into masculine and feminine which longed for each other.<br>Yes, this is my gift to you. Above ashes<br>On a bitter, bitter earth. Above the subterranean<br>Echo of clamorings and vows. So that now at dawn<br>You must be attentive: the tilt of a head,<br>A hand with a comb, two faces in a mirror<br>Are only forever once, even if unremembered,<br>So that you watch what is, though it fades away,<br>And are grateful every moment for your being.<br>Let that little park with greenish marble busts<br>In the pearl-gray light, under a summer drizzle,<br>Remain as it was when you opened the gate.<br>And the street of tall peeling porticos<br>Which this love of yours suddenly transformed.</blockquote>
