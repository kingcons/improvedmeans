In the next few days, I'm hoping to write an article about education that serves as a follow up to <em><a href="http://www./&">Towards a new HR</a> </em>and <a href="http://www./&"><em>Secondhand Standards</em></a>. It will explain a bit more about the feasibility and philosophy behind this post.<br><br>All this post is meant to do is propose a list of texts that are rigorous and provide a well-rounded foundation in Undergraduate Mathematics. Be forewarned that it leans more towards Algebraists than Topologists. Lest anyone think I'm a total quack I plan to eventually work through all of these myself and have been researching which math texts are good on and off for a few months now. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-taught">Autodidacticism</a> (to my thinking) doesn't work without good books. I also have a list for an Undergraduate Computer Science education but I'm not quite done with it.<br><br>There are 20 texts and their total cost is about 700 dollars when they're bought used off Amazon. This also covers most all of what you would learn in High School Mathematics. Click on the book's title to get forwarded to it's Amazon.com page. The ordering of the list loosely conforms to increasing difficulty but it is not a recommendation as to structure. I'll probably go into such details at a later date.<br><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Elementary-Approach-Ideas-Methods/dp/0195105192/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213023096&amp;sr=1-1">What is Mathematics? by Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins</a><br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Aspect-Mathematical-Method/dp/0691023565/ref=ed_oe_p">How to Solve It by G.
