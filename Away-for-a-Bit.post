Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>I'm going away to the beach from this Saturday to the next (7/14-7/21). There will be no posts during that time period...which is sort of tragic because I could be covering <a href="http://www.guadec.org">GUADEC</a>. But a vacation is more important. I need to remember how important it is to take time off and slow down. So, this should be good. I'll still welcome phone calls as it will be a little quiet where I am. Who knows, I may call you. I'll be down at <a href="http://www.rivardnet.com/RNS/search/propertydetail.aspx?ID=91">Sweaty Palms</a> in Grayton Beach, FL for those curious. It should be fun. Look at how easy I've made it to stalk me. Alright. Leave some love. You can begin missing Livejournal entries about music, poetry, and computer junk approximately now.
