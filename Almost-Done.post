I've been increasingly disconnected from everyone lately. School has been a fairly large part of that. After 7 months of non-stop activity including moving, the death of my father and the death of my girlfriend's father, I'm ready for a little break and a little quiet. Thankfully, from July 20th the August 24th I won't have to think about due dates and my time will be my own. I hope to be a bit more social and communicative then...but I get the feeling I'll still need to turn a few folks down to build energy back up.<br><br>The 4th of July weekend was pretty good. I wasn't as productive as I could have been but I made good headway on my CS schoolwork which would've been a real pain this week otherwise. The last class for CS is Thursday and it's the final exam. I'm hoping to do the final project in Lisp (I've already done it in C++ as required) and post a screencast of my solution to the class Google Group by then. The teacher has expressed interest in seeing it. Unfortunately, that will have to be behind my other classwork in priority. The class I'm really most wanting to be over is also the last one to end, Weapons of Mass Destruction. It satisfies a requirement for a Science, Technology and Society course and was the only such Summer '09 offered course that really fit my schedule. It's hard to explain why that class has become the one I really want to avoid schoolwork-wise but at least it will be over soon.<br><br><a href="http://theberrics.com/batb2.php">Battle at the Berrics 2</a> kicked off last weekend and while my first two predictions were spot on I also think they were obvious. My whole bracket was shot this weekend when <a href="http://theberrics.com/dailyopspost.php?postid=1161">Torey Pudwill beat Jimmy Carlin</a>. I didn't have Carlin going to the finals or anything but I was hoping that Carlin would just edge out Pudwill first round so I wouldn't have to consider Pudwill going all the way. I also was wrong about Janoski v. Ramondetta. Some major reworkings are in order and I hope to post them soon.<br><br>Also this weekend, I checked out a Kaki King album from last year titled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_of_Revenge">Dreaming of Revenge</a>. She just seems to get better and better. I also stumbled on what I found to be some deeply amusing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune">chiptune</a> by a fellow named Tugboat. It's essentially an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtBa8ydHcYY">NES-style 8-bit megamix</a> of hip-hop songs from the last few years. Cute. It seems there's plenty more chiptune where that came from and I really don't know how I feel about that.<br><br>Finally, I've got a list of tricks I'd like to land over at <a href="http://brookrunskateboardpark.com/resources/the-park/">Brookrun</a> before Fall semester starts and various unprioritized goals regarding lisp programming on the same timeline. I probably should also wrap up the funnyWords programs in lisp and haskell with the <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=982&cpage=1#comment-3776">suggested</a> <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=937">optimizations</a> and some sort of review post. What are you guys up to?
