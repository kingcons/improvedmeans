I need another dose of Milosz. Perhaps you do too. Here we go...<br><br><strong>Guardian Angel</strong><br><br>In my dreams my guardian angel takes the form of a woman,<br>Not always the same one. He knows that I, a fleshly creature,<br>Need a lover's touch. We don't make love,<br>But there is a closeness between us, and understanding.<br><br>I never believed in the presence of angels, but my dreams have changed,<br>And when, recently, I found an underground grotto filled with treasure,<br>And we were moving the sacks together, I asked him<br>For one more moment of the dream, which gave me peace.
