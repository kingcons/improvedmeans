I'm finally getting to that point where I'm really curious about math. To be sure, I'd really like to beef up on my high school math (Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus) as I haven't done any in <em>years</em>! That said, I'm really more curious about Set Theory and Abstract Algebra and at least a little interested in Linear Algebra. Topology and Number Theory can wait.<br><br>What I really think I'm curious about though are Algebraic Structures. There's a great FAQ on them <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/math-faq/mathtext/node6.html">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_system">the Wikipedia entry</a> also looks pretty thorough. Once I read those maybe I can look into Type Theory and Formal Systems and the relations between them. That said, I'm sure I won't understand anything about <a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/LieAlgebraCohomology.html">Lie Algebra Cohomology</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category Theory</a> any time soon.<br><br>At least there are good video lectures to be had. Math, Algorithms and Data Structures here I come?
