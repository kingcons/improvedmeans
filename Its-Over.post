It's really over with Sonya and me. For one reason or another, I thought there was a chance for round 2. There definitely is not. I just got off the phone with her. She won't be giving me that chance. All told, I'm glad I tried. I really needed to try and get her back for myself but that didn't work. So, on to whatever is next. I think I'll be okay but I don't really know. If anyone does want to hang out with me over the next few days or send hugs or kisses or anything though let me know. I've got orientation at SPSU from 7-3 but I'm free after that. Call me or leave a comment.<br><br>-Peace
