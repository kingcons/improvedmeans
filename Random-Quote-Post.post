I've been stumbling across these this morning and find them all quite provocative. What do you think?<br><br>"As Navrozov explains, the word "power" in Russian means "possession" and is a cognate to the English word "wield." Since in a democracy public opinion is power and universities are the source of all legitimate opinion, they can be said in a sense to possess and wield our minds. So no one at a university should be surprised to smell the marmoset, not even in an innocent little department called "computer science," but I knew the stench from childhood and to say I was shocked would be an understatement." - <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/07/my-navrozov-moments.html">Unqualified Reservations</a><br><br>"Of course, in a sense, anything you do with in a computer can be described as "mathematics." The point is not whether or not programming is math. The point is what notation is most effective for expressing programs. Choosing the best notation is the entire problem of programming language design, and this problem is neither mathematical nor scientific. A programming language is a user interface for programmers, and if you can reduce UI design to math, science, or any formal process, call Apple, not me." - <a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/08/whats-wrong-with-cs-research.html">Unqualified Reservations</a>
