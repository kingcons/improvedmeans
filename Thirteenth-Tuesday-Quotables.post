Two day late. I know. I'm a terrible slacker. I actually had some stuff pegged Monday but I just didn't manage to post it until now. These are pulled from some recent reading, <em>Open Sources 2.0</em>.<br><br>"In a commodity world, technologists need to think about innovating in their business models as much as (if not more than) innovating in their technology." - Ian Murdock, <em>Open Source and the Commoditization of Software</em><br><br>"Open Source propels software toward Commodity Land, a happy place where customers pay for real value and vendors compete on that value, not intellectual property lock-in." - Matt Asay, <em>Open Source and the Commodity Urge: Disruptive Models for a Disruptive Development Process</em><br><br>Hmm...kind of sounds like something I remember Spolsky writing a while back. "Strategy Letter V" was it? Google that.<br>Eh...on second thought I'm going to dig around for more insightful quotes for next week. These aren't blowing my hair back.
