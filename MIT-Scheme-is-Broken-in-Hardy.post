<strong>UPDATE</strong>: There is a fix for this posted on my blog <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Official-Fix-for-MIT-Scheme-in-Hardy.html">here</a>. I figured everyone would find that via google but all the traffic seems to be coming here instead. Hit the link.<br>Now, I realize both that I can use another Scheme to work on <a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com/blog/?cat=4">SICP</a> and that I can use Launchpad to submit a [patch/bug report/etc] but this is still kind of frustrating. At any rate, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/mit-scheme">going to the source</a> didn't work so I can't just use Debian's unstable packages. Going back in time and using a <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mit-scheme/7.7.90+20070205-1ubuntu1/+build/332908">Gutsy</a> or <a href="http://packages.debian.org/etch/mit-scheme">Debian Etch</a> build might do the trick though. I filed a <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mit-scheme/+bug/217792">bug report</a>. We'll see what happens. *sigh* Maybe they're all just trying to tell me to <a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2008/04/07/fedora-is-the-new-ubuntu">listen to Andy Wingo</a>. I've been meaning to play around with F9 anyway. I always do. Distro release season is so fun and it comes twice a year! More on that later.<br><br>For the curious, MIT-Scheme when run from the command line will produce the following error:<br>Largest address does not fit in datum field of object.<br>Allocate less space or re-configure without HEAP_IN_LOW_MEMORY.
