Dear Readers,<br><br>Due to unforeseen events that have slightly scrambled my brain there will not be a Linux Lesson today. In the interest of maintaining quality and not just banging something out I will wait to write and post this entry. The odds are great that it will arrive tomorrow. I apologize for the delay and thank you in advance for your understanding.<br><br>Editor-in-Chief,<br>Brit Butler
