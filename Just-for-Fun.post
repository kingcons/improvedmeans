There's so much I've been meaning to post about lately and so much that's been going on. It's <em>very hard</em> to keep up with it all. This will consequently seem a bit scattered but it's largely divided into Gifts, Linux Stuff (which continues to bring me perpetual joy), programming language stuff and hardware stuff.<br><br>Redlinux: I've been working on my own ArchLinux Derivative over the past few months and mentioned it a bit here. I'm hoping to get an ISO for an installable LiveCD of it online by the end of September with a sort of beginner's guide and homepage for it set up here. There won't be a forum or anything initially. Just e-mail me for feedback/help. We'll see how that goes. I'm calling it Redlinux. Also, I put all the default *rc files and other important config files (including new user documentation and the changelog) in a new folder on the site. It's at <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/docs/redlinux/">http://redlinernotes.com/docs/redlinux/</a>. Redlinux is currently at version v.07. The initial online release will incur an automatic version bump to the nearest .x0 rounding up.<br><br>Logos: I'm looking to get a sort of logo for the site. I'm not sure where to go with this. I also need a separate logo for Redlinux. Any ideas are welcome. I have one for a site logo. It's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">Unix Shebang</a> combined with a lowercase <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda">Lambda</a>. Like so: <strong>#!&lambda;</strong>. I think it's pretty cool but it'd take some work to make it prettier.  The <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata font</a> would be a good start. I don't think they have a lowercase lambda symbol though. :-(, Sad Panda. I'm thinking we call it the *Lambdabang*. Eh, eh?<br><br>Gifts: I've been thinking about money and my actual needs and wants a good deal lately. Part of that comes from having to constantly figure out finances due to being young and broke in a struggling economy. The other part is me thinking about the few material things I enjoy and which I'd like to prioritize. Good ideas for gifts for me that I hadn't previously considered are Internet Hosting (and you know I'll want pretty serious control over the box. Maybe <a href="http://www.linode.com/">linode</a> or <a href="http://lylix.net/archlinux">lylix</a>.), a subscription to <a href="http://www.lwn.net/">LWN</a> (Linux Weekly News) which I've been enjoying a lot lately (the back issues are free) and various books from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/32H7I8DJX2WWE?reveal=unpurchased&filter=all&sort=priority&layout=standard&x=18&y=11">the amazon wishlist</a>, as always. Cooking supplies might also be good but I'm probably best off picking those myself. Homemade good food. It's expensive, but fun!<br><br>Hardware: I've been thinking about buying a new computer for about a year to a year and a half now. I recently moved into the "strongly considering it/planning it" phase and started saving. This box would probably end up replacing my aging homemade beast of a "<a href="http://redlinernotes.com/hardware.html">main desktop</a>" which would in all likelihood become my server box. I decided fairly early on I wanted the new system to be a laptop because I'd really like to be able to go portable at any time and not be at a loss for processin power. Plus, that'll make it easy for me to move around lifestyle and home-wise which seems reasonable at the moment. To be honest, my needs are essentially met by my current equipment and the extra processing power wouldn't go to use too much as I don't game anymore. The Thinkpad A31 (present laptop) hates secure wireless networks for some reason and I wasn't able to wrestle it into submission. A larger concern would be hardware dying in the Desktop. It's still going strong but we're passing the 4-year mark and you can never be too sure. Besides, I'd love to catch some of the new emerging tech like Multicore processors, new wireless standards (Wi-Max and draft-n, I'm looking at you), and Solid State Drives! I'd also love to be able to get something based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Fusion">AMD's upcoming Fusion processors</a> but that's still a year out and I'm not sure I'll wait that long. I like the direction they've gone with the Athlon series and feel that they're more motivated than Intel to innovate. Always have. They're still not as fantastic about supporting Open Source as Intel though and that's beginning to become a deal breaker for me. Especially considering that their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_mobile_platform#Shrike_platform">Shrike mobile platform</a> may use broadcom wifi or something equally messy where Linux is concerned. I know I want something 12 or 13", preferably 13, with a minimum of 4 hours of battery life, a dual-core processor and a 60GB SSD. Ideally, it'll be Shrike-based (that's waiting a year), have HDMI or Displayport out with good Linux support and draft-n or Wi-Max. Vendorwise, I'm torn between IBM/Lenovo and Dell. I've had good experiences with Thinkpads (IBM, now Lenovo) and like them but they're not the best Open Source company. Dell has been making a real push in that direction of late and have some very competitive looking offerings which I could even <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/linux_3x?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs">buy with Ubuntu pre-installed</a>. My final three is presently a tie between the <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/na/LenovoPortal/en_US/special-offers.workflow:ShowPromo?LandingPage=/All/US/Landing_pages/ThinkPad_notebooks/2008/X300">Lenovo X300</a>, the <a href="http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?reconfigure=true&vw=icon&cart=ActiveCart&id=c5f3159b-40ce-4cc9-a652-86bc10fd928e&ecomm=ecomm.dell.com&c=us&l=en&cs=19">Dell XPS M1330</a> and the <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop_latitude_e4300?c=us&l=en&s=biz">Dell Latitude E4300</a>. I'll be coming back to re-evaluate when I've got about $1,500 stashed away. :-)<br><br>Languages: In the near future, I'd like to get a post up revising some of my former opinions on Programming Languages. Particularly of the Scheme family. Some of my earlier ramblings now seem quite misguided. Plus I've been playing around with Common Lisp more and though I'm not quite a fan of the funcall syntax I'm starting to grok some of the reasoning for multiple namespaces. My experiences with PLaneT vs. ASDF-Install bear that out. *shivers* Collisions are <b><em>ugly</b></em>.<br><br>Linux Tip: Ever been frustrated trying to transfer directories with spaces in them via scp? I have. There are one or two things that seem like they should work but don't. I've been too lazy to look up how to do it until today. Here's how:<br><code>scp -r "user@host:/path/to/directory\ withspace/" .</code><br>Simple, right? Duh.<br><br>I was going to mention how Linux Kernel Hackers make me happy and throw a few quotes from the mailing lists on here but I think this is more than enough for now. Later, folks.
