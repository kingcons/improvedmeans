You know what today was missing? Some Milosz.<br><br>I bombed a math quiz today. I mean, actually bombed. As in I think I got a zero.<br>Guess it's time to go re-read the sections and redo the homework.<br><br>I wrote a poem recently about how progress is deceptive because it doesn't feel like progress. It feels like plodding along. But I was mostly just trying to convince myself.<br>I don't think I really believe it.<br><br>I keep thinking to myself, "you've got a year or two to really excel.<br>If you can't manage that, you'll be an average person. Forever."<br>I have difficulty ascertaining whether or not my level of stress<br>or ambition, for that matter, is appropriate.<br><br>Something I accidentally wrote on the bus ride home:<br><br>I never know why we put up with each other.<br>The mystery of your flared temper or my<br>sudden detachment. But we keep blowing along,<br>buoyed by unseen currents and dancing<br>in dwindling circles. I sometimes wish,<br>might I cut the chase and stand in the center?<br>But we are opposed magnets in a small room,<br>unable to meet each other, unable to rest.<br><br>Hell with it. Here's some good sad bastard music just because.<br><object width="480" height="295" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/fMVQ1synlaU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fMVQ1synlaU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object>
