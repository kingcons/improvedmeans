Another one of my favorites. This is the second Milosz poem I ever read but it's really stuck with me. I'll give the last of my three favorites next week and then move on.<br><br>3. Paradise by Czeslaw Milosz:<br>Under my sign, Cancer, a pink fountain<br>Pours out four streams, the sources of four rivers.<br>But I don't trust it. As I verified myself,<br>That sign is not lucky. Besides, we abhor<br>The moving jaws of crabs and the calcareous<br>Cemeteries of the ocean. This, then, is the Fountain<br>Of Life? Toothed, sharp-edged,<br>With its innocent, delusive color. And beneath,<br>Just where the birds set alight, glass traps set with glue.<br>A white elephant, a white giraffe, white unicorns,<br>Black creatures of the ponds. A lion mauls a deer.<br>A cat has a mouse. A three-headed lizard,<br>A three-headed ibis, their meaning unknown.<br>Or a two-legged dog, no doubt a bad omen.<br>Adam sits astonished. His feet<br>Touch the foot of Christ who has brought Eve<br>And keeps her right hand in his left while lifting<br>Two fingers of his right like the one who teaches.<br>Who is she, and who will she be, the beloved<br>From the Song of Songs? This Wisdom-Sophia,<br>Seducer, the Mother and Ecclesia?<br>Thus he created her who will conceive him?<br>Where then did he get his human form<br>Before the years and centuries began?<br>Human, did he exist before the beginning?<br>And establish a Paradise, though incomplete,<br>So that she might pluck the fruit, she, the mysterious one,<br>Whom Adam contemplates, not comprehending?<br>I am these two, twofold. I ate from the Tree<br>Of Knowledge. I was expelled by the archangel's sword.<br>At night I sensed her pulse. Her mortality.<br>And we have searched for the real place ever since.
