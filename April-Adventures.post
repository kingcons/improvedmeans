I've been working on some of the depression issues mentioned a few posts back, making progress. Been making a concerted effort to have fun. Lots of weekend trips to Athens, socializing, concerts, that sort of thing.  Starting to create things again too! I've made a mixtape for the first time....like a proper mixtape. Did it in Audacity. Didn't try to do tempo/beat-shifting or anything fancy, just 29 minutes of cutting and fading. I still think it turned out quite well for a first effort. It leans strongly in the electronic/dance direction so if that's a big turn off for you steer clear. Anyway, onwards and upwards. And to steal from Milosz and Neruda: "Yes, this is my gift to you. Above ashes on a bitter, bitter earth. To you, to the one who unknowingly has awaited me, I belong and acknowledge and sing."<br><br>Here's the <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/docs/iomega.mp3">mix</a> and the <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/docs/iomega_tracklist.txt">tracklist</a>. (EDIT: Here's a vastly improved version of the <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/docs/iomega_final.mp3">mix</a>, the associated <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/docs/iomega_final_tracklist.txt">tracklist</a>, and where you can <a href="http://soundcloud.com/redlinernotes/iomega">listen online</a>.)
