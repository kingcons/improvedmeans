It's time to spend an afternoon at the High Museum of Art. But first, I've found a new poet: Wislawa Szymborska.<br><br><b>I'm Working On The World</b><br>I'm working on the world,<br>revised, improved edition,<br>featuring fun for fools,<br>blues for brooders,<br>combs for bald pates,<br>tricks for old dogs.<br><br>Here's one chapter: The Speech<br>of Animals and Plants.<br>Each species comes, of course,<br>with its own dictionary.<br>Even a simple "Hi there",<br>when traded with a fish,<br>makes both the fish and you<br>feel quite extraordinary.<br><br>The long-suspected meanings<br>of rustlings, chirps, and growls!<br>Soliloquies of forests!<br>The epic hoots of owls!<br>Those crafty hedgehogs drafting<br>aphorisms after dark,<br>while we blindly believe<br>they're sleeping in the park!<br><br>Time (Chapter Two) retains<br>its sacred right to meddle<br>in each earthly affair.<br>Still, time's unbounded power<br>that makes a mountain crumble,<br>moves seas, rotates a star,<br>won't be enough to tear<br>lovers apart: they are<br>too naked, too embraced,<br>too much like timid sparrows.<br><br>Old age is, in my book,<br>the price that felons pay,<br>so don't whine that it's steep:<br>you'll stay young if you're good.<br>Suffering (Chapter Three)<br>doesn't insult the body.<br>Death? It comes in your sleep,<br>exactly as it should.<br><br>When it comes, you'll be dreaming<br>that you don't need to breathe;<br>that breathless silence is<br>the music of the dark<br>and it's part of the rhythm<br>to vanish like a spark.<br><br>Only a death like that. A rose<br>could prick you harder, I suppose;<br>you'd feel more terror at the sound<br>of petals falling to the ground.<br><br>Only a world like that. To die<br>just that much. And to live just so.<br>And all the rest is Bach's fugue, played<br>for the time being<br>on a saw.
