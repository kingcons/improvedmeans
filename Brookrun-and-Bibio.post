I've gotta say, I had a really good weekend. Part of that was due to the fact that I did very little "real work". I also got to hang out with <a href="http://trashed-ideas.net/">two</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/burkehramsey">people</a> I'm quite fond of. The other contributing factors were finding a delightful new album by a guy named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibio">Bibio</a> and spending one very enjoyable evening at <a href="http://brookrunskateboardpark.com/">Brookrun Skatepark</a>. In fact, I just happened to pick up <a href="http://skateboard.about.com/od/skateboardingdictionary/g/5050Grind.htm">50-50s</a> at Brookrun. Nothing to brag about certainly but it was nice to just try them and land a few after a half-dozen trys or so on some little box. Oh, and AT&T managed to repair my crummy phone I broke last weekend so I could put off buying a new one a little longer.<br><br>The next two weeks will not likely be as fun due to finals coming up. One class ends earlier than the others so its final is the 9th. It happens to be Data Structures, the most interesting and challenging of my courses. This week's crunch is all going to be Weapons of Mass Destruction and Computer Science. (Edit: I actually found out my last Public Speaking speech will be due the day before my Data Structures Final Exam and Final Project. Thrilling, add one to the crunch.) The week after that will be Software Ethics and Public Speaking. I have to admit, I'm less worried about the latter two. Good music should make a difference though and nothing helps listening to good music like good headphones. I'd previously owned a pair of <a href="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-manufacturer/sennheiser/sennheiser-hd-212-pro.php">Sennheiser HD-212</a>s for a little over 4 years. They were definitely getting long in the tooth but I had no plans of replacing them until I accidentally left them at the bus stop back in May. There was a long search for an appropriate replacement which culminated in my purchase Saturday of some <a href="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-manufacturer/audio-technica/audio-technica-ath-m50s-w-straight-cable.php">Audio Technica M50</a>s. Thus far, I am quite pleased. They certainly make Bibio sound good.<br><br>Speaking of Bibio, the album is wonderful. I'm not sure how to explain it. It's a collage of different sounds, the guy has a very wide range of styles on display. Everything from hip-hop beat production to folk. I still really like tracks 1, 4 and 7. Seriously though, just <a href="http://myspace.com/mrbibio">give the title track a listen</a>. It's lovely, isn't it? I'm also getting into Minus the Bear but haven't spent enough time listening to it to call out anything in particular. Well, maybe the song <a href="http://skreemr.com/link.jsp?id=6B5E4350555E65&artist=Minus%20The%20Bear&title=El%20Torrente">El Torrente</a>. I've also decided to do a little bit of Rap and Hip-Hop mining to see what I can find that I like. I've always been partial to Aesop Rock and The Fugees...but that's certainly not digging deep or challenging myself. I believe Rap has more to offer. Potential listening includes: Edan, Madvillain, Ghostface Killah, The Roots, Cannibal Ox and Jay Dilla with smatterings of N.W.A., Public Enemy, De La Soul, Nas, Atmosphere, Gang Starr, Rakim, Notorious B.I.G., Madlib, Talib Kweli, Mos Def and A Tribe Called Quest.<br><br>I'll keep you guys posted on how it goes. I'm still really enjoying lisp. I intend to make it back to Haskell but I expect most of my "play code" to be in Common Lisp for a little while. I've got so many tabs open in my browser backlog that whenever I finally decide to do a linkpost it'll be positively massive. Maybe I'll try to break it up in chunks though, yeah? Anyway, that's all for now. Back to schoolwork. July 22nd can't come soon enough.
