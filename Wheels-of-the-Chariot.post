We are only what we are,<br>straining in the fog of an early morning.<br>Fearful but not yet unhinged,<br>we are waiting to spin in<br>an endless dance. Advance<br>and retreat, feints and<br>confessions. That the art of existence<br>is still an area of active research.<br>That the domain and range of man are<br>still a combative struggle. To be<br>simply is not so simple. Thoreau<br>deceived at least one. But<br>perhaps in a short time<br>we will not falter in<br>our waltz with death<br>and instead laugh,<br>like children do.<br><br>I sought in my sinew some struggle,<br>some measure of resistance, against<br>what even in youth I recognized as<br>the turmoils of a Jagannath. But my<br>vertebrae were not as strong as I<br>expected. Or dreaded maturation<br>has weakened once well-formed<br>resolve to fling my body<br>under the crushing, undulating<br>wheels of the chariot.
