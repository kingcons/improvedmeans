Promise this time.<br><em>I Ask For Silence</em>:<br><br>Now they can leave me in peace,<br>and grow used to my absence.<br><br>I am going to close my eyes.<br><br>I only want five things,<br>five chosen roots.<br><br>One is an endless love.<br><br>Two is to see the autumn.<br>I cannot exist without leaves<br>flying and falling to earth.<br><br>The third is the solemn winter,<br>the rain I loved, the caress<br>of fire in the rough cold.<br><br>My fourth is the summer,<br>plump as a watermelon.<br><br>And fifthly, your eyes,<br>Matilde, my dear love,<br>I will not sleep without your eyes,<br>I will not exist but in your gaze.<br>I adjust the spring<br>for you to follow me with your eyes.<br><br>That, friends, is all I want.<br>Next to nothing, close to everything.<br><br>Now they can go if they wish.<br><br>I have lived so much that someday<br>they will have to forget me forcibly,<br>rubbing me off the blackboard.<br>My heart was inexhaustible.<br><br>But because I ask for silence,<br>don't think I'm going to die.<br>The opposite is true;<br>it happens I'm going to live.<br><br>To be, and to go on being.<br><br>I will not be, however, if, inside me,<br>the crop does not keep sprouting,<br>the shoots first, breaking through the earth<br>to reach the light;<br>but the mothering earth is dark,<br>and, deep inside me, I am dark.<br>I am a well in the water of which<br>the night leaves stars behind<br>and goes on alone across fields.<br><br>It's a question of having lived so much<br>that I want to live that much more.<br><br>I never felt my voice so clear,<br>never have been so rich in kisses.<br><br>Now, as always, it is early.<br>The light is a swarm of bees.<br><br>Let me alone with the day.<br>I ask leave to be born.
