There was a fragment of Milosz stuck in my head the last 24 hours that I wanted to track down and get out of my system. It was originally printed as an Inscript in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unattainable-Earth-Czeslaw-Milosz/dp/0880011025">Unattainable Earth</a> but I found it reprinted in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Collected-Poems-Czeslaw-Milosz/dp/006019667X">New and Collected Poems</a> on pgs. 412-413.<br><br>What did I really want to tell them? That I labored to transcend my place and time, searching for the Real. And here is my work done (commendably?), my life fulfilled, as it was destined to be, in grief. Now I appear to myself as one who was under the delusion of being his own while he was the subject of a style. Just as they were, so what if it was a different subjection. "Do you want white peacocks?-- I will give you white peacocks." And we could have been united only by what we have in common: the same nakedness in a garden beyond time, but the moments are short when it seems to me that, at odds with time, we hold each other's hands. And I drink wine and I shake my head and say: "What man feels and thinks will never be expressed."
