May 1st was a watershed day. It was a big day for digital revolutions for two reasons. One, Dell announced they would be selling machines with Linux pre-installed. Two, HD-DVD encryption was broken and when media companies tried to censor this fact the web denizens responded in a massive virtual riot. The tenuous connection between those two things is that they both demonstrate the growing power of networks over hierarchies where structures of organization or authority are concerned. I realize this may seem a ridiculous or unsubstantiated claim and if you want I'll argue it with you personally or in the comments. To start though I just thought I'd post a few links.<br>First, a link to the official dell announcement: <a href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/05/01/13147.aspx">Ubuntu on Dell. Yay</a>.<br>Second, a nice visualization of the extent of the HD-DVD rioting: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=09+F9+11+02+9D+74+E3+5B+D8+41+56+C5+63+56+88+C0">900 thousand google results when I searched regarding the riot</a>.<br>Third, news stories about the HD-DVD rioting: from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/2007/05/02/digital-rights-management-tech-cx_ag_0502digg.html">Forbes</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03code.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/the-day-the-digg-users-revolted/">twice</a>. I'm sure there are others.<br>Finally, a few different views and examples of the protest: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgj7Z52616Y">Youtube</a>, <a href="http://blog.sesse.net/blog/tech/2007-05-03-00-52_dear_helpdesk.html">IPv6 addresses</a>, <a href="http://www.pthree.org/2007/05/02/image-puzzle/">an Image Puzzle</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9HaNbsIfp0">a Song</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=09+F9+11+02+9D+74+E3+5B+D8+41+56+C5+63+56+88+C0&amp;m=text">a flickr search</a> and our new celebrity of course has <a href="http://09-f9-11-02-9d-74-e3-5b-d8-41-56-c5-63.com/">it's own website</a>. <a href="http://09f911029d74e35bd84156c5635688c0.com/">Two, in fact</a>.<br><br>While I feel these produce a pretty good pastiche of May 1st's two events and their significance it may not be fully evident. If that's the case, let me know in the comments or contact me and I'll try to explain it in a short but thorough post later. I may just do it anyway...<br><br>Update: Added the flickr search link. Very cool. Also wrote that second piece but it didn't end up being so short.
