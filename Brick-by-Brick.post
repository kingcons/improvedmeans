So spring break is finally here and I've gotten nothing done the past...5 days. I threw a small get together on Friday, went to a <a href="http://www.justinmorgancomedy.com/">friend's stand up</a> show on Saturday, saw the Watchmen on Sunday, and saw <a href="http://www.justinmorgancomedy.com/">the same friend</a> yesterday to watch Synecdoche, NY...which reminded me that I just don't get Charlie Kaufman films. The Kaufman films amaze me they're just incomprehensible. I can't infer the meaning to his metaphors, usually.<br><br>That's not all I've done these past few days but you get the picture. Worse (or better) still, my social schedule is booked. I'm already hanging out with people Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Friday night and Saturday night. It's ridiculous. I'm never going to get my math homework done. Anyway, where was I?<br><br>The more I think about it the more interested I am in writing or composing music of my own and there's no question that I want to do it digitally. I may even write my own software tools to do it but that's way down the line. A lot of the trouble is I don't know how to get started making music on a machine at all. Or off one. It's sort of this big, ominous thing for me. I don't think of myself as being that creative or talented anyway but I don't care. I'm going to try it. I'm still sampling things occasionally. I just need to find some piece of software to help me string it all together.<br><br>I've been at least a little productive. I've cranked through the first few chapters of Real World Haskell and would like to keep a one chapter a day pace. The <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/code">code is browsable</a> on the new server's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial_(software)">mercurial</a> repo. One good thing has occurred to me these past few days. Spring break isn't wildly different than my normal schedule. Sure, I don't have homework or Tuesday or Thursday classes but I don't think that's holding me back from being truly productive or learning things I want. If I just invent the right structure for myself I think I can do still more than I'm doing now. It's something worth thinking about.<br><br>After all, there's so much out there to study. I'm interested in picking up some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category Theory</a> from a (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu">djvu</a>) copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories/dp/0521478170">Conceptual Mathematics</a> I found out on the interwebs. I'll probably buy a copy at some point, I have a problem when it comes to books. Anyway, aside from that there is tons of great free material out on the web. Herbert Wilf's <a href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/%7Ewilf/DownldGF.html">Generatingfunctionology</a> and <a href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/%7Ewilf/AeqB.html">A=B</a> are both available free online and there is an interesting text on the <a href="http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.html">Basic Concepts of Mathematics</a> and one on <a href="http://www.efgh.com/math/algebra/">Modern Algebra</a>, and another on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071111181302/http://germain.umemat.maine.edu/faculty/wohlgemuth/">proofs</a> that I may work on. Beyond that, there's <a href="http://www.crsr.net/Programming_Languages/SoftwareTools/index.html">tons of</a> <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell">free material</a> on <a href="http://www.lisperati.com/haskell/">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://www.adampetersen.se/articles/lispweb.htm">Lisp</a> so I have no reason to be bored. Oh, and as always Brian and Robert over at Enfranchised Mind are always putting out <a href="http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/posts/programming-doesnt-suck-or-at-least-it-shouldnt/">good</a> <a href="http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/posts/the-programmer-is-dead-long-live-the-developer/">articles</a>.<br><br>Last but not least, BT wrote the entire song that follows in the CSound programming language. Granted, it took him 6 months and hundreds of pages of code but still...<br><div><!--  @import url(http://skreemr.com/styles/embed.css); --><br><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><br><tbody><br><tr><br><td class="sk-topleft" width="16"><img style="padding:0;border:0;" src="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-topleft.gif" alt="" /></td><br><td class="sk-toprow">BT - All That Makes Us Human Contin</td><br><td class="sk-topright" width="16"><img style="padding:0;border:0;" src="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-topright.gif" alt="" /></td><br></tr><br><tr valign="middle"><br><td class="sk-lightleft3" width="16"></td><br><td class="sk-lightback3"><object width="290" height="24" data="http://skreemr.com/audio/player.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="align" value="middle" /><param name="flashvars" value="playerID=1&amp;bg=0xCDDFF3&amp;leftbg=0x357DCE&amp;lefticon=0xF2F2F2&amp;rightbg=0xF06A51&amp;rightbghover=0xAF2910&amp;righticon=0xF2F2F2&amp;righticonhover=0xFFFFFF&amp;text=0x357DCE&amp;slider=0x357DCE&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0xFFFFFF&amp;loader=0xAF2910&amp;soundFile=http://dave.thehhp.net/music/bt/BT-This_Binary_Universe-CD-2006-eMF/01-bt-all_that_makes_us_human_continues-emf.mp3" /><param name="src" value="http://skreemr.com/audio/player.swf" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="quality" value="high" /></object> <img style="padding:0;border:0;vertical-align:bottom" src="http://skreemr.com/images/skreemr_logo_small_name_only.png" alt="" /></td><br><td class="sk-lightright3" width="16"></td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td width="16"><img style="padding:0;border:0;" src="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-bottomleft.gif" alt="" /></td><br><td class="sk-bottomrow">Found at <a href="http://skreemr.com/link.jsp?id=6259435656546A12&amp;source=embed">skreemr.com</a></td><br><td width="16"><img style="padding:0;border:0;" src="http://skreemr.com/images/corner-bottomright.gif" alt="" /></td><br></tr><br></tbody></table><br></div>
