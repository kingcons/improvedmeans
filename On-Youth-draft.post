This popped out in my Discrete Mathematics class today after walking there listening to Funkadelic's Maggot Brain and reading some of Pablo Neruda's work. Tell me what you think. Also, title suggestions please.<br><br>Youth, I know not what became of you.<br>Lakes and cities, a fiery rebellion.<br>Always aware of a justice without touch or name.<br>You walked with me through the mud caked<br>ruins behind the trees of the subdivision<br>and sought out with me a refuge from the<br>savages in the weeds of back roads and trails.<br>You were there when the infection poured<br>out from the skin of my back like mineral water<br>from the mountain. You were there for<br>escapes to beaches and oceans whose splendor<br>seemed to swallow all that I knew.<br>But that was another world.<br>These days only the vaguest memories remain.<br>Flickering images whose sources cannot be pinned<br>down, absent of references or citations. Only a feeling<br>and a thought which, I know, as Milosz has said are<br>"too much for the meager word".<br>How is it that I am nostalgic for what I cannot recall<br>of my own life? A great sadness wells up within me.<br>As though what cannot be remembered did not occur.<br>I know that to be a fallacy, but in my weakness must<br>hope that in some eternal memory that beauty<br>and difficulty which I suffered does persevere.
