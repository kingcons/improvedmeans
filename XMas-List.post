Just for the heck of it, you know?<br><br>Hardware<br>It'd be pretty swell if I could get a <a href="http://computers.pricegrabber.com/flat-panel-lcd-monitors/m/32539308/search=FP222WH">BenQ FP222WH</a> Flatscreen Monitor. It takes HDMI input so I wouldn't need a TV in my first apartment!<br>Zareason is producing some <a href="http://www.zareason.com/shop/product.php?productid=16162&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1">Ubuntu keyboards</a> and I need a USB keyboard to hack on my PS3 so that would come in handy.<br><br>Content<br>Considering that I'm leaving school for a bit this list will mostly be books to study next semester but really anything off my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/32H7I8DJX2WWE?reveal=unpurchased&amp;filter=all&amp;sort=priority&amp;layout=standard&amp;x=9&amp;y=3">Amazon wishlist</a> will do bookwise.<br>The following 12 books would be my 12 books of Xmas. They're of particular importance to me. And I say buy used.<br><br>Algebra by I.M. Gelfand (Author), Alexander Shen (Author)<br>Functions and Graphs (Dover Books on Mathematics) by I. M. Gelfand (Author), et al.<br>The Method of Coordinates by I.M.

Cormen (Author), et al.<br>Watchmen (Absolute Edition) by Alan Moore (Author), Dave Gibbons (Illustrator)<br><br>Finally, you gotta have some useless stuff:<br>Like video games. Uncharted on the PS3 and Okami or Shadow of the Colussus or Rogue Galaxy on the PS2.<br>And wall art. I guess I should have something on at least one wall in the apartment next semester right?<br>Cool wall art includes <a href="http://www.imagekind.com/GalleryProfile.aspx?GID=3b76f798-e4ca-450c-990a-f9881d704eaf&amp;P=1">disassembly maps of famous old games</a> like Super Mario Bros and Pac-Man. Or some of the <a href="http://xkcd.com/store/">cool internet maps</a> from the XKCD store.<br><br>Yeah. That's about all I can think of. Be careful though. Give me all that stuff and some rice and you might not hear from me for another few months. Now then, what do you guys want for Christmas (or insert holiday here)?
