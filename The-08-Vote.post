I just voted. I'll repeat what I said last night: You should too. If you're eligible that is. Anyone interested in coming over to keep an eye on the prediction markets and the rolling numbers for the polls is welcome. I'm setting up a bit of a command center here in the basement with my 22" LCD watching <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/election/election.xul">Peter Seibel's data mashup</a> or fivethirtyeight, if you insist, and the TV ready for CNN or what have you later.<br><br>Also, I'll be baking brownies. That's right. Brownies. Maybe even some fried chicken. We'll see. Now come over and let's do this.
