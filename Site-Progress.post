This weekend has gone alright. I've caught up on some things I haven't got done in a while. I'm back into reading (which is Lessig at present) and been working on the site a little. There's tons to do. I just hope to have everything up the way I want before my birthday. Anyway, I'm mostly working on stylistic aspects right now and infrastructure (the FTP). Once that's done it's on to moving the old livejournal posts over and moving music onto Redline Radio. Anyway, have a peek folks and let me know how it looks to you. Also, let me know if you can see everything. I don't know how this looks below 1280x1024 resolution.<br><br><a href="http://www.redlinernotes.com">RedlinerNotes.com</a><br><br>Also, who thinks <a href="http://goukihq.org">this guy's page</a> layout is awesome and I should steal the frontpage design and possibly the about section?
