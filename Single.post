I remember when my hand was cut and I snuck over to your house on the first day we were together and you bandaged it.<br>I remember when I cooked you salmon and we made love, in my bedroom.<br>And so this is life. Rich, more than we are able to absorb in all it's facets, too rich for us.<br>Rich, beyond comprehension. Full, beyond belief. My cup overfloweth. And I know not what to do.
