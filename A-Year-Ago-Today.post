<a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?p=972">A year ago today</a>, my Dad, John M. Glenn Jr died of non-smokers lung cancer. Mom and I still miss him terribly but I think if he were here he'd be proud of how we've carried on and on how much we've accomplished and enjoyed in the intervening time. Wherever you are John Glenn, you are loved and remembered. We were lucky to know you.
