as part of a getting things done streak. You know? Like, learn x y per z. Anyway, aside from reading SICP and writing code, getting it posted on here, and getting this essay up these are the other thing I've been lagging on:<br><a href="http://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/emacs.html">An Emacs Tutorial</a><br><a href="http://smalltalk.gnu.org/blog/bonzinip/using-git-without-feeling-stupid-part-1">Git Tutorial Part 1</a><br><a href="http://smalltalk.gnu.org/blog/bonzinip/using-git-without-feeling-stupid-part-2">Git Tutorial Part 2</a><br><a href="http://www.scottklarr.com/topic/115/linux-unix-cheat-sheets---the-ultimate-collection/">A Much more focused collection of *nix &amp; associated utilities sheets</a><br><a href="http://www.cheat-sheets.org/">A Massive Index of Cheat Sheets</a><br><br>Also, I'm not sure I buy it but there was some <a href="http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.commentview&amp;comment_id=74">pretty optimistic news</a> about Concentrated Solar Power today. I'd love to see more detailed plans and a price/time-to-completion estimate.<br><br>Finally, if anyone has any insights about why I'm getting a bad EIP value and a kernel panic whenever I try to transfer large files (or dozens of songs) with my server, feel free to let me know. I will buy you a (coffee/beer/etc). It seems related to <a href="http://forums.suselinuxsupport.de/index.php?showtopic=64275&amp;pid=260356&amp;mode=threaded&amp;show=&amp;st=&amp;#entry260356">this issue from an openSuse user</a>. It could also be related to me using the 8139cp module instead of 8139too for my ethernet card. Whatever, I doubt i'll get anywhere but I'll be looking into it.<br><br>Now to grab dinner and finish that essay...
