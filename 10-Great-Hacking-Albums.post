My posts on this blog have leaned away from technical content for the last year, tending towards the introspective and music or poetry. I'm hoping to start shifting back in the other direction for a little bit and plan to write about my latest personal hacking project soon. In the interim, here are 10 favorite albums to write code to off the top of my head. I will note at the outset that I prefer ambient and instrumental music for hacking. Ambient stuff in particular seems to naturally encourage a state of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29">flow</a>" for me. Also, here's a link to some <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MentalStateCalledFlow">C2 wiki discussion on flow</a> as it relates to programming. Also, as long as we're throwing out great hacking music I might as well <a href="http://soundcloud.com/redlinernotes">shill the mixtapes I've been working</a> on the last two months. :) All three are pretty solid. And there's a one hour extended mix that mashes together I/Omega and Lost Without a Traceback that isn't on soundcloud. Ping me if you're interested. There are some track changeups and much improved transitions in the I./Omega half.<br><br><strong>Hackerjams</strong>:<br>Tim Hecker - Harmony in Ultraviolet<br>Tim Hecker - An Imaginary Country<br>Tim Hecker - Ravedeath, 1972<br>Fennesz - Venice<br>Fennesz - Black Sea<br>Fuck Buttons - Tarot Sport<br>Rustie - Glass Swords<br>Araabmuzik - Electronic Dream<br>Four Tet - There Is Love In You<br>Amon Tobin - Supermodified<br><br>(Honorable Mentions: Tycho - Dive, Washed Out - Life of Leisure)<br><br>If you were to proceed through the above albums in sequence, you'd start with some fantastic downtempo ambient/noise stuff with Hecker and Fennesz, shift into uptempo "noisetronica" with the Fuck Buttons, transition into the over the top and in your face Rustie, ride those dancey vocals and synths into Araabmuzik, and then start winding down with the more midtempo vocals of There Is Love In You and the outstanding groove of Supermodified.
