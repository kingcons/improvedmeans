It's already Fall semester. How messed up is that? I haven't learned near as much as I was hoping to by now. That said, I'm no longer as much of an idiot when it comes to programming. I'm just unlearned. Well, maybe that's what I was before. At any rate, some good fortune has come my way in that department. I'm helping out with a very cool startup related to cloud computing and getting mentored by a guy doing the sort of work I'd be interested in. He also happens to share some of my views on society and education.<br><br>I've had lots of financial thoughts lately. It's funny when you realize that you can count on one hand the material things that make you happy and count on the other hand your material needs. Afterwards you should figure out what it really costs you to <em>happily</em> live (barring dependents) and figure out just how money jobs could consequently sustain you that way. Take that, put it in your pipe and smoke it.<br><br>Two parting thoughts:<br><br>One, this <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=285107">hackernews</a> discussion on the article <a href="http://ournature.org/~novembre/illich/1970_deschooling.html">Deschooling Society</a> is excellent. Someone should make a Facebook note about it and get some OU kids in on the discussion.<br><br>Two, Red Hat and Fedora's servers got hacked recently. The situation was resolved before any nastiness could filter downstream. CentOS servers were unaffected though and this makes me wonder if Fedora didn't share infrastructure whether they would've been hacked as well. What's the thought here? Well, it makes me think there's <em>less</em> incentive to attack community distributions and, similarly, community products. I could certainly be wrong. Your thoughts?
