I was hoping to make a few posts today but I'm working on homework for tomorrow so that won't come to pass. I wanted to get something up before tomorrow though so I thought I'd mention a recent technology development that has brought me some joy.<br><br>I've been putting off getting a smartphone for a few years now. At first, because I didn't think I would make good use of the extra features and more recently because I wasn't satisfied with the available options. That dissatisfaction was primarily of a sort of political nature rather than a technical one. That is, I was satisfied with the quality of the technology available but not satisfied with the freedom and control it allowed. I seem to have <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Digital-Lifestyle-Efficacy-or-a-Theory-of-Technology-Purchases.html">written briefly about this before</a> in 2007. I'd like to expand on it at some point, in particular on <em>What Technological Freedoms Are and Why They Are Worth Fighting For</em>. I wonder if there's an interested audience. Then again, much of what I write may be without that.<br><br>For a time, there was an effort for a technically mediocre but politically liberated device called the OpenMoko which I was following mostly back in 2007. They made a valiant effort but ultimately fell short of what I deemed a suitable product. Also, my phone was less in need of replacing in 2007. More recently, I've been <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Midweek-Miscellany.html">watching</a> <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Officially-Summer.html">the</a> <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Off-Every-Wall-in-the-Building-An-Update.html">cell phone market</a> with an eye towards replacing my aging Nokia around Xmas. Android phones had been striking an acceptable but less than perfect balance between freedom and technical excellence but they still weren't quite what I wanted. There had been whispers for months about a Nokia phone which would be based on Open Source and thoroughly awesome.<br><p style="text-align: left;">Finally, they announced it. It looks to be completely and ridiculously awesome. There are a few <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhTtsZATwBQ">over the top</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au_uRmoy8Fs">videos</a> and two <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP5R-5NX1BE">hands-on</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyGblwHyNXs">videos</a> (warning: latter video in Italian) but if you're really interested check out the <a href="http://maemo.nokia.com/n900/specifications/">specs</a> and <a href="http://maemo.nokia.com/features/">software features</a> pages. Very Happy. Also, possibly the most important thing...Freedom:</p><br><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://redlinernotes.com/images/n900_root.png" alt="N900: Jailbroken on Arrival" /></p><br><p style="text-align: left;">Anyway, I'll be fiending for that thing until it's in my hands. In the mean time, I hope to get some more posts up. Surely, I can crank out one during my Algorithms class tomorrow. Explanation forthcoming...</p>
