So, a quick post of things that have been happening.<br><br>It's official. Apple and Palm are at war. And I couldn't be happier about it. Apple has pulled stupid, anticompetitive maneuvers many a time that simply serve to frustrate users of its software. One is making sure that iTunes <em>only works</em> with iPods. Palm made a phone that was designed to sync with iTunes and sync it did. Apple intentionally released a patch to iTunes shortly after the release of Palm's Pre phone that broke that functionality. <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2009/07/23/palm-webos-1-1-now-available-fixes-itunes-sync/">Palm has just released a fix</a> that restores the sync functionality. So guys, are you just gonna keep doing this or will there be a court date I should know about?<br><br>The HTC Hero has finally <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5318860/htc-hero-review-tragically-flawed">started</a> <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/htc-hero-review-2149880/">to</a> <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2009/07/20/review-htc-hero/">see</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/23/htc-hero-review/">reviews</a> drop and while the software is good, the phone's CPU is old and underpowered...so now I'm waiting...again...for either a wild Maemo phone announcement from Nokia or some solid reviews (or just confirmation at this stage) about the Sony Ericsson Xperia X3 (aka "<a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/tag/rachael/">Rachael</a>"). I certainly wouldn't mind getting the Hero but it looks like my next phone purchase won't come until at least Xmas.<br><br>In the meantime, there are plenty of other things holding my interest. One is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483">Coders at Work</a> book <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/">Peter Seibel</a> is working on. It's <a href="http://codersatwork.com/endgame.html">schedule</a> keeps getting pushed back but it should be out "Real Soon Now". <a href="http://www.nicklevine.org/">Nick Levine</a> is also working on a book called "Lisp Outside the Box" for O'Reilly that has some <a href="http://lisp-book.org/contents/">cool contents</a>. No word on a release date yet though. I'll be watching.<br><br>One piece of big and great news is that <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/images/teresa.jpg">Teresa</a> has switched to <a href="http://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. Jaunty i386, to be specific. Her XP install kept having problems and I didn't feel like spending time fixing them. Since switching her last weekend, things have gone quite smoothly.<br><br>I also had a little interest in trying Karmic out because of their <a href="http://tarpon.wordpress.com/2009/06/19/google-android-ubuntu/">Android support</a> but didn't feel like messing with my partition table. I figure I'll upgrade her system when it releases and won't have an Android phone anyway. I still have a little bit of a distro fixation lately it seems because I finally want to play with a source-based distribution and have been particularly intrigued by Daniel Robbins' Funtoo project. It's a gentoo derivative and given how much free time I have I'll likely <a href="http://funtoo.org/en/articles/funtoo/quick-install-howto/">try it</a> in Virtualbox soon. It'd have to be <em>insanely great</em> to pull me away from Arch however. As OSWatershed.org attests, <a href="http://oswatershed.org/">Arch's "stable\current" packages just can't be beat</a>. :) Of course, there are disclaimers on OSWatershed.org's site about the numbers. I'm not trying to start a flame war and I'll be trying Funtoo unstable/future anyway.<br><br>My buddy <a href="http://trashed-ideas.net/">Max</a> posted a link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-m6JDYRFvk&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Ftrashed-ideas.net%2F&feature=player_embedded">coder girl</a>. This doesn't fit in anywhere, it just makes me speechless. Cheers.
