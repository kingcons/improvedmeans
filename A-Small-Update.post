It's been a while since last post. I'm going to try to maintain that this year. If I don't have something worth putting up, screw putting something up. Maybe there will be some longer, better written essays as a result. For now, I'm putting up poetry which I haven't done in a <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/blog/?cat=4">*long* time</a>. Wrote this one on the bus to school. Feels okay. PS: I've really fallen in love with Band of Horses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_All_the_Time">first album</a>.<br><br>Dopplegangers<br>I can only see another in you and<br>how she must wind up in 10 years,<br>though I barely knew her.<br><br>So you have a husband, two daughters.<br>Biscuits in a cafe on a cool Sunday.<br>A man seemingly earnest, invested.<br><br>Is this what becomes of us?<br>I remember it differently.<br>Lazy promises I made myself<br>about who we each would be.<br><br>Please, let us remain ever becoming.
