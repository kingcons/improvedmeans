I was just thinking about something...blogs may be more useful for soliciting help when you know next to nothing about something than when you know a good deal about something. For example, if I post an exceedingly technical question my readership is (statistically) unlikely to know the answer. Sure, if Dave Airlie and Patrick Logan and a bunch of other hackers read my blog I might get a quick response but it's pretty unlikely. However, if I ask a general question about which I'm simply clueless there are much better odds of getting a meaningful and informative response from my readers. As a thought, this probably isn't worth blogging. But it struck me...and I did. So there.
