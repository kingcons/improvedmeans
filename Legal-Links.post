Today's linkpost will focus on two topics. One is the NSA's immoral spying activities which <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9845595-7.html">Obama promised to fix</a> on his campaign trail and the other is the ever expanding mire of modern Intellectual Property Law.<br><br>Let's start with the NSA. There have been three separate arstechnica articles lately about the failures of the NSA spying program. One of the articles discussed the extent to which <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/07/nsa-program-too-secret.ars">the program's secrecy made it useless to traditional intelligence workers</a>, another talked about how the warrantless wiretapping that was exposed was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/07/black-box-origins.ars">just the tip of the iceberg</a> and a third <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/07/r2e-nsas-power--and-money-sucking-datacenter-buildout-continues.ars">condemned the continuing money being thrown into data centers for the NSA</a> whose output we cannot quantify or evaluate.<br><br>That said, it all made me realize just how much arstechnica is an echo chamber for my own views. In Cass Sunstein's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Republic-com-Cass-Sunstein/dp/0691070253">Republic.com</a> and <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/11/07/sunstein/">other places</a> he is a bit more alarmist about this than I would be but he's still a smart guy and onto something. With that in mind, I should at least comment that there does seem to be some positive pressure for Obama to live up to his promise, however meager, between <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-536-Civil-Liberties-Examiner~y2009m6d16-Feingold-questions-Obama-on-warrantless-wiretapping">angry senators</a> and increased news coverage. In addition, some hold a <a href="http://acandidworld.com/2009/07/17/is-obama-following-through-on-his-promise-to-end-warrantless-wiretapping-should-he/">much more balanced view that promotes waiting and seeing</a>. The NSA position was a major factor in my support of Obama though or at least the belief that he would bolster what are, in my view, weakened civil liberties and constitutional law...and I'm a bit impatient and touchy about it.<br><br>As for stupid IP law, the madness just goes on and on. It's hard to know where to begin. I think I blogged about this already but a quick and obvious example is a music industry group that thinks they should be able to charge you each time your phone rings if you have a "musical ringtone". As a matter of fact, they're cleverly <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/06/ringing-up-cash-ascap-suing-att-for-ringtone-performance.ars">suing AT&T over it</a>. At least my enemies are fighting each other. But let's just break their view down for a second. So, you can buy little 10-15 second clips of songs to serve as ringtones when people call you now. And these guys think that whenever someone calls you...and that song, or clip of a song, plays in public, <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/06/ascap-wants-be-paid-">it counts as a public performance of the work and copyright law entitles them to money</a>. What? The same group <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/17/nyregion/ascap-asks-royalties-from-girl-scouts-and-regrets-it.html?pagewanted=1">struggled to get girl scouts to pay royalties for singing copyrighted songs around a campfire</a>, such as "Happy Birthday" and "Row, Row, Row". I don't normally swear on this blog but might I say, Get The Fuck Out. You have no idea what music, or culture for that matter, is good for. Just leave. I get pretty irate about this stuff. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/07/industry-study-claims-strong-copyrights-fuel-economic-engine.ars">Strange conclusions</a> are being reached about what good copyright law is doing.<br><br>On the bright side though, Obama has made a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/06/obamas-uspto-choice-supports-patent-reform.ars">USPTO choice which supports patent reform</a>. Patent law, like copyright law, has gotten wildly out of hand in the last two to three decades and I fervently hope Mr. Kappos takes steps to bring some sanity to the system. Above and beyond that, there are still reports coming from academia alleging that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/06/researchers-conclude-piracy-not-stifling-content-creation.ars">piracy is not stopping artists</a> and the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/06/swedish-pirate-party-headed-to-european-parliament.ars">pirate party has made it to parliament in Europe</a>. There are also <a href="http://rc3.org/2009/07/23/a-shopping-cart-for-reuse-rights/">continuing efforts to try new approaches</a> that adapt to modern conditions. Let's just consider IP Law to have two sides and call it a day for now. And I don't mean <a href="http://pwang.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/in-defense-of-bsd-licenses/">BSD</a> vs <a href="http://zedshaw.com/blog/2009-07-13.html">GPL</a>. Sheesh.
