"Past" by Pablo Neruda:<br>We have to discard the past<br>and, as one builds<br>floor by floor, window by window,<br>and the building rises,<br>so do we keep shedding-<br>first, broken tiles,<br>then proud doors,<br>until, from the past,<br>dust falls<br>as if it would crash<br>against the floor,<br>smoke rises<br>as if it were on fire,<br>and each new day<br>gleams<br>like an empty<br>plate.<br>There is nothing, there was always nothing.<br>It all has to be filled<br>with a new, expanding<br>fruitfulness;<br>then, down<br>falls yesterday<br>as in a well<br>falls yesterday's water,<br>into the cistern<br>of all that is now without voice, without fire.<br>It is difficult<br>to get bones used<br>to disappearing,<br>to teach eyes<br>to close,<br>but<br>we do it<br>unwittingly.<br>Everything was alive,<br>alive, alive, alive<br>like a scarlet fish,<br>but time<br>passed with cloth and darkness<br>and kept wiping away<br>the flash of the fish.<br>Water water water,<br>the past goes on falling<br>although it keeps a grip<br>on thorns<br>and on roots.<br>It went, it went, and now<br>memories mean nothing.<br>Now the heavy eyelid<br>shut out the light of the eye<br>and what was once alive<br>is now no longer living;<br>what we were, we are not.<br>And with words, although the letters<br>still have transparency and sound,<br>they change, and the mouth changes;<br>the same mouth is now another mouth;<br>they change lips, skin, circulation;<br>another soul took on our skeleton;<br>what once was in us now is not.<br>It left, but if they call, we reply,<br>"I am here," and we realize we are not,<br>that what was once, was and is lost,<br>lost in the past, and now does not come back.
