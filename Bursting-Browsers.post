My browser is filling up with tabs and I'm tired of it so it's time for a link dump. There were probably also things from my Google Reader that I wanted to post in here but that thing moves so fast I can never keep up with it. Honestly, it's impossible. Maybe I should start reading less.<br><br>This year is starting to come together nicely. I'm enjoying school a lot and as far as I can tell so far I've been kicking ass and taking names...not that I should brag about it. It's not like I'm in a really tough school and it's not like I'm far into my major. Oh, well.<br><br>I still find the two most interesting topics in Computer Science to be Operating Systems and Programming Languages. We're still so early in the computer age. I think there's a long way left to go. I don't have anything smart to say about OSes and PLs because there is too much I have left to learn. Instead, in the next few days I hope to talk a bit about Emacs and LaTeX. I swear by that text editor at this point. The more you use it the more you get sucked into it I suppose...but I can imagine switching from Firefox to Emacs for browsing.<br><br>Speaking of which, Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 should be coming out soon and we all should want that. It's about time Tracemonkey got here...and if you have any memory usage improvements or additional stability bring them my way. I'm a ridiculous internet user to be sure and I average about 40 tabs most of which have a decent amount of javascript or images but I still think we can do better. Hammer away guys!<br><br>Now then, about those links:<br>- First of all, there are some notes from a POPL 2009 track that I found highly interesting <a href="http://plgrand.blogspot.com/">here</a>. I hope that things are indeed shaken up as much as they suggest over the next 10 to 15 years. There is cause for optimism as much as despair. It's been <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3193">posted on LtU</a> and hopefully some good comments will turn up there.<br><br>- Bruce Schneier thinks we should have <a href="http://rc3.org/2009/01/21/data-breach-notification-laws/">Data Breach Notification laws</a>. Makes sense don't you think?<br><br>- The Scheme Language Steering Committee is <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/steering-committee/election/announcement.html">going through an election</a> soon and I'm pretty interested in taking part. Naturally, they have a fantastic lineup of <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/steering-committee/election/nominees.html">nominees</a>. I'm one of those people that's a little dissatisfied with R6RS but I am unaware of the historic RnRS before R5RS so I should probably read up before voting. Who am I kidding though? I'll never find the time. We'll see what happens.<br><br>- Following up from the first article, the links <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7t5vi/the_highlevel_cpu_challenge/">here</a> to the original article, follow up, and LoperOS are all fairly interesting. I'm actually pretty happy with the state of computing as it is these days but I don't have to write code professionally...and I'm certainly not opposed to escaping todays methods\tools\PLs\OSs\ISAs\etc.<br><br>- Speaking of tools though we do have some incredible tools today, like <a href="http://www.ptlsim.org/">this Cycle Accurate x86 simulator</a>. I don't know when I would need it...but it is there.<br><br>- There have been some interesting thoughts on the economic stimulus lately. I think three of my favorites are <a href="http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/01/how_economists_analyze_the_stimulus.php">this one</a>, <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/worldchanging_fulltext/~3/520503687/009345.html">this one</a> and <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/10/romer-and-bernstein-on-stimulus/">this one</a>. <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/economicbs">This post</a> talks about how to spot economic BS which is of course also useful in these hectic times. We'll still forget <a href="http://rc3.org/2009/01/04/why-financial-regulation-is-necessary/">these lessons</a> in a scant few years, I fear.<br><br>- I still think there's a good bit wrong with both our economic and education systems at several levels but they're the best we have right now. After all, our <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-01-09/dirty-secrets-of-college-admissions/full/">college admissions processes are admittedly pretty arbitrary</a>. Hopefully they'll improve in the future but in the meantime I think a lot of the problems are summed up well <a href="http://andrewfarmer.name/2008_02_mis_education">here</a>. In the meantime, let's all just <a href="http://www.ltlprints.com/blog/think-differently/">think differently</a> and remember <a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/2008/12/30/branford-marsalis-take-on-students-today/">what Brandon Marsalis said</a>.<br><br>- Bruce Sterling has a good bit to say about the <a href="http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/343/Bruce-Sterling-State-of-the-Worl-page01.html">State of the World in 2009</a> and though this is one hell of a thread there are some extremely interesting views present. It's definitely worth a half hour or so of reading, even if you can't finish it.<br><br>- As for thinking about the future, keep these two things in mind: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html">Work on something that matters</a> and this probably will be a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126881.400-genetic-manpulation-becomes-a-hobby.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news">Genomic century</a>.<br><br>- While we're on the not quite computing train, I might as well mention the wonderful works of Elizier Yudkowsky again whose <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/fun-theory-sequence.html">recent series on Fun Theory</a> has provided some throught provoking material. *shrug* Maybe it suits you maybe not. Here is a <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/fun-theory-laws.html">summary</a>. There has also been some talk on Overcoming Bias about <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/tribal-biases-and-the-inauguration.html">Obama's Inauguration</a> and <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/set-obamas-bar.html">Setting the Bar now</a>. That's certainly worthwhile too.<br><br>- Speaking of Operating Systems and Foundations of Computing and all that bull, here's something worth reading/thinking about. I haven't actually used Plan 9 but there are (I think) <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=447435">some very good comments in this thread</a> and things worth pondering.<br><br>- This is interesting if only because it seems reasonably honest/unbiased and <a href="http://web.mac.com/jimbokun/iWeb/Site/Blog/AB35C167-7755-4113-938C-968F65256D76.html">explains many of the pros and cons</a> of a broad array of languages. That said, I don't see any concatenative languages represented and that makes me a little sad.<br><br>- Last but not least are a few thoughts on our new president from Rafe Colburn: <a href="http://rc3.org/2009/01/22/a-great-day-for-america/">Thank God the torture is over</a> and <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/obama-picks-critic-of-warrantless-wiretapping-for-slot-at-justice-dept/">this choice makes me deeply, deeply happy</a>.<br><br>Between <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/">Google Code University</a> is pretty cool but what I'm really excited about is their <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a>. In the past I've read about it but if I can learn enough and get my act together quickly enough I may actually be able to participate this year! We'll see. A friend offered to <a href="http://lispnyc.org/soc2009.clp">mentor me for LispNYC</a> if I can come up with <a href="http://lispnyc.org/wiki.clp?page=soc-student-rr">an appropriate project</a> and I'm both flattered and excited but I've got <a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2008/12/building-lisps.html">a lot to learn</a> between now and then before I can do anything really useful. Back to my lisping. On a related note, I would keep my eye on this site over the next few months. I expect we'll all be seeing some <a href="http://kloudshare.com/">really neat stuff</a>.<br><br>Finally, a few tangents. Some of the stuff people create in LittleBigPlanet is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/12/littlebigplanet-used-to-create-32-cell-computer-game-of-life.ars">astounding</a>. <a href="http://www.biscade.com/office/">These</a> <a href="http://www.stefandidak.com/office/index.php#homeoffice1">guys</a> need to stop their home computer office wars...but I think I can say I actually prefer my setup to theirs. I've made good choices based on my needs, so have they. That's enough for now. I should try doing something <em>actually</em> productive. Later guys.
