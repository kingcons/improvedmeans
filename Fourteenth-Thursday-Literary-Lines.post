More Neruda today, the end of his poem <em>Autumn Testament</em>, from the work "Extravagaria".<br>If you all really like it I'll be happy to post the full text to Autumn Testament which numbers a few pages...<br><br>From having been born so often<br>I have salty experience<br>like creatures of the sea<br>with a passion for stars<br>and an earthy destination.<br>And so I move without knowing<br>to which world I'll be returning<br>or if I'll go on living.<br>While things are settling down,<br>here I've left my testament,<br>my shifting extravagaria,<br>so whoever goes on reading it<br>will never take in anything<br>except the constant moving<br>of a clear and bewildered man,<br>a man rainy and happy,<br>lively and autumn-minded.<br><br>And now I'm going behind<br>this page, but not disappearing.<br>I'll dive into clear air<br>like a swimmer in the sky,<br>and then get back to growing<br>till one day I'm so small<br>that the wind will take me away<br>and I won't know my own name<br>and I won't be there when I wake.<br><br>Then I will sing in the silence.
