A lot has been happening lately and I guess I've been too wrapped up in it to write anything down here. I've been readmitted to <a href="http://www.spsu.org/">SPSU</a> for the Spring 09 semester, have filed the <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">FAFSA</a> and am currently looking into financial aid options. I'll have more on that soon but I am planning on going. Better to be there and learning than out of school doing Help Desk work and not learning enough about programming. That said, I'm totally out of funds about now and a part-time Help Desk position would be wonderful for the foreseeable future (i.e. post starting at SPSU). Or a contract position until school starts.<br><br>Due to the aforementioned brokeness I won't be grabbing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> which a few people have asked me about. I am impressed with some of the things people have churned out with it though including a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2008/10/07/littlebigplanet-used-to-create-1600-part-calculator-video">working 1,600 part calculator</a> and a <a href="http://www.ripten.com/2008/11/03/littlebigplanet-gradius-level-video/">recreation of Gradius</a>. Cute.<br><br>Will also got back in touch with me which I was quite happy about and I <a href="http://redlinernotes.com/code/rev/bb8dc37124e9">made some changes at his suggestion</a> to my little hangman program. It's down to 115 lines of code and is pretty polished at this point. The only way to go forward would be to add new features but I'll put that aside until I've finished <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">PCL</a>. I also may have a quick weekend project to write a BASH script for RedLinux in the near future thanks to <a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/index.html">some of the</a> <a href="http://tldp.org/guides.html">great resources at the Linux Documentation Project</a>. I've got some ideas for a future RedLinux release but I'll likely put that off until December or so.<br><br>What else has been going on lately? Well, OOPSLA and Lisp50 happened <em>fairly recently</em> and I couldn't make it but I've enjoyed reading about it thanks to <a href="http://lispy.wordpress.com/2008/10/">articles on Lispy's blog</a> and <a href="http://lukego.livejournal.com/17711.html">some words from Luke Gorrie</a>. I'm still pretty jealous of Luke Gorrie as he always seems to be playing with <a href="http://lukego.livejournal.com/18214.html">neat ideas</a> <a href="http://lukego.livejournal.com/18161.html">and technologies</a> and generally hangs out with the "<a href="http://lukego.livejournal.com/17442.html">cool kids</a>" a lot. He was at OOPSLA and Lisp50 and then <a href="http://lukego.livejournal.com/18540.html">managed to be hanging out with Alan Kay</a>, Ian Piumarta and co at <a href="http://www.vpri.org/">VPRI</a> when <a href="http://factor-language.blogspot.com/2008/11/west-coast-trip-100-success.html">Slava Pestov came through</a> to talk about <a href="http://factorcode.org/">Factor</a>. What a jerk! (jk lukego) There's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3df_0QlhYlS8g%26amp%3bfmt%3d6">great video of Slava's Factor talk</a> which he delivered at Google as well. It would be neat if some of the Lisp50 talks made it online but somehow I don't expect to see that happen. I've also been keeping an eye on the <a href="http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs">btrfs</a> and <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2008-November/">xorg</a> mailing lists but that's not too relevant really. BTRFS for 2.6.29!<br><br>I've been doing a little bit of reading on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/en/Lisp_Machine">Lisp Machines</a> of late and hope to run one in a VM when/if I get <a href="http://blog.kingcons.io/posts/Lusting-for-a-Laptop-Lenovo-the-Liberator.html">an X200</a>. I'd also love to run a copy of <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.01">Linux 0.01</a> <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Dusting_Off_the_0.01_Kernel">in QEMU</a> or VirtualBox and maybe <a href="http://www.reactos.org/">ReactOS</a> as well. Nothing like a small, well-understood system right? A nice external keyboard wouldn't hurt either as mine has gotten a bit beaten down over the years and is a PS/2 keyboard so it won't play with the X200. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7apqt/ask_progreddit_can_you_recommend_me_a_good/">Reddit has some suggestions</a> and I'm rather leaning towards a <a href="http://daskeyboard.com/">Das Keyboard</a> but one of the mechanical-switching Cherry units would be fine too. Paul Stamatiou has some <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/09/02/back-to-college-shopping-guide-off-campus-edition">interesting suggestions about back to school stuff</a> but I'll mostly stick to his thoughts on study habits and motivation. I think I've got the rest sorted out. His thoughts on <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/08/21/how-to-live-the-cloud-life">living the cloud life</a> and <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2008/02/12/how-to-download-with-newsgroups">using newsgroups</a> should be useful though.<br><br>That's all for now. I'm off to skateboard and shower while there's still some good sunshine out before hunkering down with more lisp. Did I mention a <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/news.html">new version of SBCL</a> came out? Don't forget to vote tomorrow. Keep an eye on things with the help of <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/election/election.xul">Peter Seibel </a>and <a href="http://www.xkcd.org/intrade/">Randall Munroe</a>! Fivethirtyeight.com won't hurt either. ;-)
